  <li><span>6 March 2017</span> » <b>Introduction to Indian Philosophy -- Satischandra Chatterjee</li></b>
  <br>
    Indian Philosophy seems to be concerned with, <i> Karma </i>, <i> Self-Liberation </i>, Brahman, </i>
    <i> Soul </i>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>There are various schools of Indian thought -- Mimasa, Vedanta, Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisesika.
    The book defines, <b>Karma as the law of conservation of moral values.</b> Karma leads to bondage of soul by matter. It is
    the reason for suffering. So the question would be, How to liberate? </p>
    <p>It didn't seem that a lot of things are happening in Indian philosophy, and most of the schools are
    reacting to each other. </p>

    Perhaps there are things happening within Indian Philosophy, And I might not be aware?
    <br>
    <br>
  <li><span>26 Feb 2017</span> » <b>History of Philosophy -- Roger Scruton</li> </b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
      Roger Scruton is an excellent writer. I came across his Green Philosophy -- Which argues for protecting the environment.
      However, he says -- we protect because our ancestors have left it to us. </p>
      <p>
      In this book, he starts with Science, as the realm of empirical investigation. It stems from an attempt
      to understand the world, to predict and explain observable events, seeks to ask,<i> "What causes that?"</i> </p>
      <br>
      This question intrigues me,
      <i> <b>Why should there be any events at all? </i></b>
      <br>
      <p>
        <br>
      He says –– Philosophy ought to seek for truth, and abstractions. And then, he goes on to explain
      various thinkers in Western tradition, starting from Descartes who changed the way, people began to
      think. Spinoza's system was deterministic, and his theory of knowledge follows Plato. There's also
      Leibniz, David Hume, Hobbes, Berkeley and others. </p>

  <li><span>7 Feb 2017</span> » <b>Von Humboldt</b></li>

      <h2>Political Science</h2>

        <br>
<p>
        Von Humboldt's book -- Limits of State Action is a classic in Liberalism.
        He says, what end state institituons should be set to their activity is the main question of Political Science.
        <br>In other words, What is the limit of the State?
        <br>
        <br><b>Other questions that come under it: </p></b>
<br>
      <ul>  Who shall be governed? <br>
        Who shall govern?
        Working of administration? <br>
        Sphere of Government </ul> <br>
<p>
        Somethings that went through my mind as I read his book were,
        his argument that, <i>Freedom is pre-requisite for progress in society. </i>
        His argument is that, without freedom, people are coerced into doing something they do not like.
        If it is so, then their heart would not be content, therefore they will not innovate. It does seem true.


      </p>
        He also emphasized a lot about focusing on Inner life, meaning focusing on Virtues. He cites the Greeks <br>
        as examples, And it does seem true. <i>Remember</i>, he wrote this book around 1790's. The State's main function is <br>
        security from foreign powers, and internal crisis. <br>
        <br>
        <b>"Every Occupation of whatever nature is more efficiently performed, <br>
        if pursued for its own sake alone, rather for the results to which it leads" -- Von Humboldt <br> </b>
        <br>
        I recommend you reading this book.
