     <p>Travelling is fascinating, it expands your horizons -- However, living in another country or place is different from travelling. I have travelled to a wide variety of places.
      Usually, I post my thoughts, history and facts about these places. If you have any questions or feedback please do email me.

<hr>

      <p> <li><b> <h2> | INDIA | US | MIDDLE EAST | JAPAN | FIJI </b></li></h2>
        <br>

        <p>  Most of my early travels are in parts of Tamil Nadu. People speak Tamil and English in Tamil Nadu
        The State, where I grew up. I've found that one culture can learn from another rather than looking down.
        Most of the time, people misunderstand cultures. Indeed, there's a lot of history, that we all need to learn from each others cultures. <br>

    <li><span>16 Jan 2017 </span> <b> Tamil Nadu </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Most parts of Tamil Nadu looks the same in terms of Architecture, except for the weather.<br>
        Some great facts about Tamil culture is that, I found Sangam period as a foundation of Tamil culture, literature.
        They had worthy moral precepts, stories. However, it is not popular in the West -- I think, they are worth studying and spreading wisdom and knowledge.<br>
        <p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
      <b> <u> Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India. </b> </u>
<br>
<br>
<img src="../../img/travel/kodai.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
<br>
<br>
      <p>  Kodaikanal is known as princess of hill station.
        A Hill station is where we have a village near the top of a hill.
        The Weather is around 70 degrees to 60 degrees.
        It formed as a retreat place for Missionaries, British elites in Tamil Nadu.
        People in Tamil Nadu soon started to see it as a wonderful place, and started relocating to Kodaikanal.
        I have been to Kodaikanal numerous times, And -- it is one of my favorite places on the planet.
        If you plan to visit Tamil Nadu, I recommend staying in Kodaikanal for a week.
        You will enjoy the perfect weather, scenery and forest.</p>
        <br>

        <u> Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India. </u> <br>
<br>
<br>
        <img src="../../img/travel/nellai.JPG" height="400" width="450"></img>

    <br>
    <br>
        Tirunelveli has semi-arid weather. <br>

        Semi-arid, mostly hot with 10-20 days of rainfall a year <br>
        <br>
        It's a small town with about 500,000 people living in the district.<br>
        There's a popular destination called, Coutrallam. <br>
        It has few waterfalls, where people often go for a small retreat. <br>
        I've been to coutrallam many times, And I fall in love with majestic water-fall.<br>
        <br>
        Tirunelveli has excellent middle and high schools. They call it the Oxford of South India.<br>
        Most of the credit goes to early Christian missionaries who founded these schools.<br>
        Other than that, there's not a complete history of Tirunelveli.<br>
        If you find something let me know. <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
      <u>  Coimbatore    <br></u>
    <br>
        Coimbatore has 70 degrees weather, and rains often. <br>
        However, the city has numerous migrants from other parts of India.<br>
        Coimbatore also has excellent schools, and institutions.<br>
        Close to Coimbatore, there's Ooty, which is similar to Kodaikanal.<br>
        I've visited it three times. The Railway station is peculiar, and has an underground walk-way.
        <hr>
    <br>
    <br>
        <u>Chennai</u> <span> Madras </span><br>
    <br>
        Chennai is probably bigger than NYC, and is capital of Tamil Nadu.
        It's hot, humid and has a lot of traffic.<br>
        I would say NYC's traffic is nothing compared to Chennai. <br>
        During my time in Chennai, I saw how fast Chennai was growing economically. <br>
        It's interesting to visit a crowded city if you are young, And Chennai has lot of things to do.
        If you are into History, I'd recommend checking out all the English East India company's history in Chennai.<br>
        A lot of people in Chennai are proud of it. It was formerly called as Madras.<br>
        The first time, I visited Chennai was in 2008 during vacation <br>
        After that, I moved to Chennai for four years. <br>
<hr>
    <br>
      <u>  Madurai    <br></u>
    <br>
        Madurai is 150 kms from Tirunelveli. The City of Madurai's icon is Meenakshi Amman Temple, if you have not seen it. Find out the details of architecture, it's unique in History. I'd say Dravidian Architecture is unique and has stone-cut temples. Other than that, there's other temples, people.
    <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
      <u>  Trivanduram, Kerala    <br></u>
    <br>
    <br>
        Trivanduram, I visited it from my early schooling days. It's similar to other Tamil Nadu towns, cities. The Weather is not too hot as Tirunelveli. It's around 80 degrees. People speak Malayalam in Kerala. If you have not noticed, people in India speak different language, depending on the state.
    <br>
    <hr>
        <u> Kottayam, Kerala    <br></u>
    <br>
        Kottayam was greener and I enjoyed my time visiting on a train.   <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
        <u>New Delhi</u>
    <br>
    <br>
        I was so much excited to be in New Delhi.<br>
        <br>
        And as soon as I got from a train, I could see people from all over India were there.<br>
        Remember, India is diverse as Europe.<br>
        <br>
        And that makes India special. India was doomed to fail after the British had left, <br>
        however -- India is still going on as a Nation. Anyway, I noticed  <br>
        clean/good areas of New Delhi were near consulates, <br>
        and I must admit they had poorer parts too in New Delhi.<br>
        A lot of the signs in New Delhi were in Urdu (remember), this was surprising.<br>
        I think, it goes back to the Mughal Empire. <br>
        I visited some of the bazaars in New Delhi, they were crowded with tons of people.<br>
        Infact, I was traveling alone so I couldn't get much feedback from locals.<br>
        I wish -- I had stayed there for a while to learn about the place.<br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>  <u>Gurgaon, Haryana.<br></u>
    <br>
        From New Delhi, there's trains to Gurgaon. It is similar to New Delhi, but new thing I noticed was that Northern India has rickshaws, and they called their three-wheeled transport vehicle as fat fatia. Probably in Southern India, I have not seen them, and people in Tamil Nadu called them as Autos.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

  <u>Tajmahal, Agra. </u>

  <br>
  <br>

  <img src="../../img/travel/tajmahal.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
  <br>
  <br>
  What can I say about the Taj Mahal? Majestic architecture, grandeur, opulent, symbol of Mughal Empire.Taj Mahal is a must-visit in India <br>
  Infact, if you love history or architecture -- Then you'll fall in love with it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <hr>
      <u> Middle East  <br></u>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../../img/travel/middle.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
      <br>
      <br>

    <br>
        In fact, this place was fascinatingly different. The first difference is clothing style, next is weather. I couldn't research much on the history of it because I couldn't talk to the locals. Although, I must warn people who visit Middle East for the hot weather. It gets as hot as 122 degrees. I loved the Desert, it looks different than Europe or North America.
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br><u>Fiji</u>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../../img/travel/fiji.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>

    <br>
    <br>
        Fiji is a great place to visit, you would love the weather in summer. <br>
        People are friendly. Fun fact, there are Indians in Fiji, who have assimilated to Fijian culture. <br>
        Fijians would belong to Islander culture. <br> 
        <br>

    <br>
    <hr>
        <br>
        <u>Thailand</u><br>
        <span> Bangkok </span><span>Pattaya</span>
    <br>
        Thailand has friendly people. A lot of travel and tourism in Thailand.<br>
        The first you might notice in Bangkok is that it's a huge city
        similar to NYC.
        Bangkok has dozens of Buddhist temples. I don't think Thailand has winters,
        they have a lot of things to do in Thailand. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <u> <h2> North America</u> </h2>
    <br>
        These are some of the states, that I've visited. One important factor is, if you prefer weather to be a huge factor,
        then most of the colder states won't attract you. Unless, you are from Russia or Iceland. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

        Illinois
    <br>
    <span>Rockford, Illinois </span>
    <br>
    <br> The first thing you'll notice is Chicago's airport is huge, and the parking lots go on forever <br>
          Illinois had bad roads. Winters are brutal in Illinois. <br>


    <hr>
        Wisconsin<br>
        <span> Madison, Wisconsin </span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Wisconsin had good roads, compared to it's neighbour Illinois. <br>

    <br>
    <hr>
        Rhode Island <br>
        <span> University of Rhode Island </span>
        <br>
        <br>

        <img src="../../img/travel/rhode.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
        <br>
        Blizzards are common in North-East. Rhode Island is near to Boston. <br>
        <br>
        <hr>
    <br>
        New York City
        <br>
        <br>

        The most diverse city on Planet. <br>
        There's plenty of things to do in NYC, and the city never sleeps <br>
        You can find all kinds of food in NYC, literally from any country on the planet <br>
        I visited Randall's Park in NYC, And also attended a friend's wedding in Central Park. <br>

      <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
        Florida
        <br>
        <span> Orlando, </span> <span> Daytona </span>
        <br>
        Florida –– to a northerner (U.S), the buildings look different.<br> The Vegetation, plants, weather is tropical.
        Sunny weather, and lot of South American food.<br>
        <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
        West Virginia
        <br>
        <span> Princeton, West Viriginia </span>
    <br>
    <br>
  <img src="../../img/travel/west.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
  <br>
  <br>
  West Virginia is considered rural place, but I might say -- we can't have it all in a state.
  Either you have too many people, or less. West Virginia has winters, but they're not as a cold as North-East of America.
  The Airport (Charleston) is small, the city is considerbly small and peaceful. If you like small places, with less people,
  you might enjoy it unless, you can't stand rural places.
    <br>

        California
<br>
<br>
        I've visited San Fransico and I must admit, it had wonderful weather <br>

    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
        Texas
        <br>
      <br>  "Everything is bigger in Texas" </br>
      <br>
      Texas has similar weather to Southern India. A lot of immigrants,
      the first thing, I noticed in Texas was the airport had Bush's name. Other than that,
      there's a lot of mexican cultural influence in Texas. Texas is huge, it takes a couple of days to drive around the state.
      They say, they have ranches as big as Rhode Island.
<br>
<hr>

    <br>
        Oregon
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Portland, Oregon</i> is similar to North-East. However, Oregon's coastline is distinct and beautiful.
        I visited Newport, Oregon and found coastline to be picturesque.
        <hr>
    <br>
        Massachussets
        <br>
<br>
        Massachussets is the intellectual hub of America, World's top universites, four seasons.
        If you come from Southern hemisphere of the Globe, then Mass will expose you about cold weather.
