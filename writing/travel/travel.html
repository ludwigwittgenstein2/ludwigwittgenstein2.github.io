  <li><span>12 Jan 2017</span> Â» <a href="1.html">Travel</a></li>
   <p><h2>Welcome to my travels page. </h2>

     <p>Travelling is fascinating, And expands your horizons -- However, living in another country or place is different from travelling.


    <p> I have been to a lot of places. </p>
    <p> Usually I post my thoughts, history and facts about these places. <br>
     If you have any questions, feedback please do email me.</p>



      <p> <li><b> <h2> | INDIA | US | MIDDLE EAST  </b></li></h2>
        <br>

        <p>  I have travelled to most parts in Tamil Nadu. <br>
        The State, where I grew up. And I obviously respect the tradition. <br>
        I find that one culture can learn from another. Most of the time, people misunderstand cultures.<br>
        Indeed, there's a lot of history, that we all need to learn from each others cultures. <br>

    <li><span>16 Jan 2017 </span> <b> Tamil Nadu </b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Most parts of Tamil Nadu looks the same in terms of Architecture, except for the weather.<br>
        Some great facts about Tamil culture is that, I found Sangam period as a foundation of Tamil culture, literature. <br>
        They had excellent moral precepts, stories. However, it is not popular in the West -- I think, they are worth studying and spreading wisdom and knowledge.<br>
        <p>
<br>
<br>
      <b> <u> Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India. </b> </u>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/img/travel/kodai.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
<br>
<br>
        Kodaikanal is known as princess of hill station. <br>
        A Hill station is where we have a village near the top of a hill. <br>
        The Weather is around 70 degrees to 60 degrees. <br>
        It formed as a retreat place for Missionaries, British elites in Tamil Nadu. <br>
        Soon -- People in Tamil Nadu started to see it as a wonderful place, and started relocating to Kodaikanal. <br>
        I have been to Kodaikanal numerous times, And would say -- it is one of my favorite places on the planet. <br>
        If you plan to visit Tamil Nadu, I recommend staying in Kodaikanal for a week. <br>
        You will enjoy the perfect weather, scenery and forest.<br>
        <br>
    <br>


        <u> Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, India. </u> <br>
<br>
<br>
        <img src="../../img/travel/nellai.JPG" height="400" width="450"></img>

    <br>
    <br>
        Tirunelveli has semi-arid weather. <br>
        It's a small town with about 500,000 people living in the district.<br>
        There's a popular destination called, Coutrallam. It has few waterfalls, where people often go for a small retreat.<br>
        I have been to coutrallam many times, And I always appreciate the water-falls.<br>
        Tirunelveli has a lot of excellent schools,<br>
        most of the credit goes to early Christian missionaries who founded these schools.<br>
        Other than that, there's not a complete history of Tirunelveli.<br>
        If you find something let me know. <br>
    <br>
      <u>  Coimbatore    <br></u>
    <br>
        Coimbatore has 70 degrees weather, and rains often. <br>
        However, the city has numerous migrants from other parts of India.<br>
        Coimbatore also has excellent schools, and institutions.<br>
        Close to Coimbatore, there's Ooty, which is similar to Kodaikanal.<br>
        I've visited it three times. The Railway station is peculiar, and has an underground walk-way.
    <br>
    <br>
        <u>Chennai    <br></u>
    <br>
        Chennai is probably bigger than NYC, and is capital of Tamil Nadu. It's really hot and has a lot of traffic.<br>
        I would say NYC's traffic is nothing compared to Chennai. <br>
        During the time, I saw how fast Chennai was growing economically. <br>
        It's always interesting to visit a city, And Chennai has lot of things to do. <br>
        If you are into History, I'd recommend checking out all the English East India company's history in Chennai.<br>
        Lot of people in Chennai are proud of it. <br>
        It was formerly called as Madras.<br>
        The first time, I visited Chennai was in 2008 during vacation <br>
        After that, I moved to Chennai for four years. <br>

    <br>
      <u>  Madurai    <br></u>
    <br>
        Madurai is 150 kms from Tirunelveli. The City of Madurai's icon is Meenakshi Amman Temple, if you have not seen it. Find out the details of architecture, it's unique in History. I'd say Dravidian Architecture is unique and has stone-cut temples. Other than that, there's other temples, people.
    <br>
        <br>
      <u>  Trivanduram, Kerala    <br></u>
    <br>
        Trivanduram, I visited it from my early schooling days. It's similar to other Tamil Nadu towns, cities. The Weather is not too hot as Tirunelveli. It's around 80 degrees. People speak Malayalam in Kerala. If you have not noticed, people in India depending on the state, have their own language.
    <br>
        <u> Kottayam, Kerala    <br></u>
    <br>
        Kottayam was greener and I enjoyed my time visiting on a train.   <br>
    <br>
        <u>New Delhi</u>
    <br>
        I was so much excited to be in New Delhi.<br>
        <br>
        And as soon as I got from a train, I could see people from all over India were there.<br>
        Remember, India is diverse as Europe.<br>
        <br>
        And that makes India special. India was doomed to fail after the British had left, <br>
        however -- India is still going on as a Nation. Anyway, I noticed  <br>
        clean/good areas of New Delhi were near consulates, <br>
        and I must admit they had poorer parts too in New Delhi.<br>
        A lot of the signs in New Delhi were in Urdu (remember), this was surprising.<br>
        I think, it goes back to the Mughal Empire. <br>
        I visited some of the bazaars in New Delhi, they were crowded with tons of people.<br>
        Infact, I was traveling alone so I couldn't get much feedback from locals.<br>
        I wish -- I had stayed there for a while to learn about the place.<br>
    <br>
    <br>  <u>Gurgaon, Haryana.<br></u>
    <br>
        From New Delhi, there's trains to Gurgaon. It was similar to New Delhi, but another new thing I noticed was that Northern India has rickshaws, and they called their three-wheeled transport vehicle as fat fatia. Probably in Southern India, I have not seen them, and people in Tamil Nadu called them as Autos.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
<br>
  <u>Tajmahal, Agra. </u>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="../../img/travel/tajmahal.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
  <br>
  <br>
  What can I say about the Taj Mahal? Majestic architecture, grandeur, opulent, symbol of Mughal Empire. <br>
  Taj Mahal is a must-visit in India <br>
  Infact, if you love history or architecture -- Then you'll fall in love with it.
  <br>
  <br>
      <u> Middle East  <br></u>
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="../../img/travel/middle.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>
      <br>
      <br>

    <br>
        In fact, this place was fascinatingly different. The first difference is clothing style, next is weather. I couldn't research much on the history of it because I couldn't talk to the locals. Although, I must warn people who visit Middle East for the hot weather. It gets as hot as 122 degrees. I loved the Desert, it looks different than Europe or North America.
    <br>
    <br><u>Fiji</u>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="../../img/travel/fiji.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>

    <br>
        Fiji is a great place to visit, you would love the weather in summer. <br>
        People are friendly. <br>

    <br>
        <br>
        <u>Thailand</u>
    <br>
        Thailand has super friendly people. A lot of travel/tourism in Thailand.
    <br>
    <br>
      <br>
      <u>  North America</u>
    <br>
        These are the states, that I've visited. Please do not take my views seriously.
    <br>
        Illinois
    <br>
        Wisconsin
    <br>
        Rhode Island
        <img src="../../img/travel/rhode.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>

    <br>
        West Virginia
    <br>
    <br>
  <img src="../../img/travel/west.JPG" height="350" width="450"></img>

    <br>
    <br>
        California
    <br>
    <br>
        Texas
      <br>  "Everything is bigger in Texas" </br>
      Infact, Texas has similar weather to Southern India. A lot of immigrants,
      the first thing, I noticed in Texas was the airport had Bush's name. Other than that,
      there's a lot of mexican cultural influence in Texas.
