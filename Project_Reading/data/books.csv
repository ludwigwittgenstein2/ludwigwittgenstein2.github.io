Does this mean, you’d allow, “Flat Earth.” Mill says, yes — why? Because, it would not be good to silence minority view, in doing so, would be tyranny. <br/><br/>Although, I am not sure how Mill defines truth. His theory of truth, could be debate, and his premise might hinge upon it. <br/><br/>Nigel takes a tour on famous cases on Free Speech, his example on famous Holocaust denier, brought lights to me on legal rights.

It seems that there are many variables within this social identity and marker, which could be pursued further. <br/><br/>Ritual dominance is not necessarily dominate attribute of Caste (Sanskritization i.e emulating Brahmin priest rituals). Many lower castes have asserted their self-hold through mobilizing politically; once supine and docile, now militant and aggressive. <br/><br/>All the field examples could be applied to other societies in India i.e Tamil Nadu, which I am primarily concerned about. <br/><br/>I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Caste, Indian History, Politics.

At times, other programmers might misconstrue names from our programs, we want to make sure we think of other programmers and how they would interpret our code. <br/><br/>Comments are invaluable and should be used only when it helps in understanding the code better. We follow standard left to right value variable while using control flow and minimize as much as possible for using deep nested loops. In case of complex expressions or giant expressions, as much as we can minimize mental stack for other programmers, it is easier to maintain, code is less likely to create bugs. <br/><br/>As much as possible, the essential functions can be implemented from pertinent programming library so that we write less code. Each function needs to contain one task at a time and organize as much modules, functions as possible. <br/><br/>I have a summary of entire book, if you do want it, PM me. <br/><br/>Deus Vult, <br/>Gottfried",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Why do computers break? They break a lot, a lot. It’s due to bad programming. But what is this root cause? It boils down to complexity. <br/>We’d need programming to reduce complexity. Art in programming - reducing complexity into simplicity. <br/><br/>A good programmer needs to do everything in his power to make what he writes as simple as possible to other programmers. A good programmer creates things that are easy to understand. <br/><br/>A Program is sequence of instructions given to the computer, it’s the actions taken by a computer as a result of being given instructions. Improving the code, improves quality of software. It’s one of the most important problem we’d need to solve. <br/><br/>Chapter 2: Missing Science<br/><br/>The Author writes that this book is about Software Design. We know what a software is about, it’s about a set of instructions to achieve many functions. What would be Software Design? <br/>Design is to make a plan for creation, in this case, we are planning in advance about the software. This would involve, tools, structure of code, technical decisions. <br/><br/>A Code that exists also has a design, in which structure or the plan that seems to follow. We’d need to ask questions like: <br/><br/>-What should the structure of our program code be? <br/>-Is it more important to focus on having a fast program or a program whose code is easy to read? <br/>-In this software design, which programming language should we use? <br/><br/>To make it concise, I’d say — anything that involves architecture of the software, technical decision while creating the system falls within the purview of software design. <br/><br/>We’d need to know that every programmer is a designer. Usually, the lead developer is in-charge of designing overall architecture of entire program. “Every programmer who writes a software is a designer.” <br/><br/>Can we say Software design is a science? The easiest answer is no, let’s look at why it is not a science: <br/>- Science must contain knowledge that has to be collected<br/>- This knowledge must have a way to be organized <br/>- It ought to contain basic laws or general truths<br/>- It also needs to tell how to do something in physical universe <br/>- As far as we know, science is discovered through scientific method, which involves observation and experimentation<br/><br/>Let’s look at the fundamental laws of software design: <br/>-Definitions tell you what something is and how you would use it <br/>-Facts are true statements about something <br/>-Rules are statements that give advice over something <br/>-Laws are facts that always be true and cover a broad area of knowledge <br/><br/>In the above, laws are the most important. How does this book help us? It’s teaching us the science of software design (we think it is a science or assume to be), very few people are taught the software design process, instead they are taught a programming language and then asked to write some software. This book is filling the gaps between them. <br/><br/><br/>Chapter 3: Driving Forces of Software Design: <br/><br/>Every time we write a software, we’d need to know exactly what the purpose of the software and why we are crafting the software. If we analyze it deeper, the single purpose of all software is to, “Help People.” If we break this purpose, we can understand it concretely: <br/>Some specific pieces of software exists to help specific groups of people. A word process exists to write things. A Web browser exists to help people browse the web. The author says, purpose of software is not to make money or to show of how intelligent a person has become. It would violate principle of purpose in software, and lead to low-quality software. When we are given feature requests, we’d have to think, which feature would help the most number of people. <br/><br/>The author backs up his statement of purpose of a software is not to make money through expanding it. He says, to make money would be a personal purpose or purpose of an organization, but it ought not to be the case of the software. The two main primary factors that determine the income of software company is probably, the business skill and how much your software helps people. Business skill involves administration, management, marketing and sales. <br/><br/>Let’s summarize from the above paragraphs about purpose of software. We do know that, the goal of software is to help people. To be specific, the following points should be considered: <br/>1) To allow us to write software that is as helpful as possible<br/>2) To allow our software to continue to be as helpful as possible <br/>3) To design systems that can be created and painted as easily as possible by their programmers, so that they can be and continue to be as helpful as possible. <br/><br/><br/>Chapter 4: Future <br/><br/>An important question that faces every software designer is, how do I make decisions about my software and which decision would be the best? To rephrase this question, given possible decisions, which of those decisions are best out of all possibilities. <br/><br/>D = V/E,<br/><br/>D stands for desirability of change <br/>V stands for value of change<br/>E stands for the effort involved in performed the change. <br/><br/>Essentially, it says any change is directly proportional to value of change and inversely proportional to effort involved in making change. Value here means the degree to which this change helps anybody anywhere. It adds financial support to your own self as adding value. Value could be potential value and probability of value. In the above equation, we miss one important component, time. Features within a software change in value over time. If we include time and other attributes, then it becomes: <br/>D = Vn + Vf / Ei + Em <br/><br/>Where Vf is value in future, Vn is value now. Ei effort of implementation, Em its effort of maintenance. We don’t want a situation where effort is $100k and value is $0.10, We’d want the opposite way, where effort is $10 and value is $100k.<br/><br/>The idea solution for guarantee success is to design our system in such a way that maintenance decreases over time, eventually becomes zero. In short, it’s important to reduce effort of maintenance than it is to reduce effort of implementation. <br/><br/>It’s easy to write software that helps one person right now, but it’s difficult to write software that would help millions of people now and to continue that in the future. If we just make things work in the present, then our software becomes hard to maintain in the future. Sometimes we are safest if we don’t assume to predict the future, but make design decisions with the information present now. <br/><br/>Chapter 5: Change<br/><br/>We know that the longer our software exists, the more probable it is that any piece of it will have to change. The common mistakes that software designers make when coping with change: <br/>-Writing code that isn’t needed<br/>-Not making the code easy to change <br/>-Being too generic<br/><br/>We don’t write code that we do not need it. Un-used code clogs the system. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. Being too generic in the design doesn’t help users<br/><br/>Chapter 6: Defects and Design: <br/><br/>Good programmers introduce one defect into a program for every 100 lines of code. The best programmers introduce for every 1000 lines of code. The chance of introducing a defect into your program is proportional to the size of changes you make to it. So if we have smaller changes, we have fewer defects and less maintenance.<br/><br/>The best design is one that allows for the most change in environment with least change in software. <br/><br/>“Never fix anything unless it’s a problem and you have evidence showing that the problem really exists.”<br/><br/>Don’t repeat yourself, this means that in your software system, any piece of information should ideally exist only once. We should not be copying/paste blocks of code, instead we allow one piece of code to call others. This helps us in making changes, if we make changes in one piece of coding, then it will automatically change in other aspects of the software system.<br/><br/>Chapter 7: Simplicity<br/><br/>The ease of maintenance in any piece of software is proportional to simplicity of its individual pieces. We cannot have perfect ease of maintenance, but it’s the goal we strive for in our system. Remember this doesn’t apply to whole system but only individual pieces. An average human being cannot comprehend whole pieces of the software. He can only comprehend pieces of it. The simpler each pieces of the software is, the easier to maintain. <br/><br/>We’d need to write code in simple, self-contained pieces where fixing defects and maintaining the system is easy. If we design a large, complex chunk, then each piece of work doesn’t get polish as much but it’s harder to maintain. However simple is relative, what we write as simple would be simple to us but not simple for our co-workers or customers. Always write good documentation that starts with, “New to this code?” So that a person who has no understanding can read your code. The worst of all is a software with no documentation, where you are just expected to figure out for yourself, or already know, how the code works. We’d need our code to be simple, in this case, stupid and dumb simple. What this means is when other programmers look at your code, do you want them to feel frustrated and angry or confused and frustrated? In addition to keeping it simple, being consistent in the code is important. Finally some other things that add to simplicity is readability that includes spacing, naming things so other programmers can understand the code, commenting it. <br/><br/>If we don’t pay attention in designing a system, it evolves into a massive, complicated beast. Sometimes when we design it, which takes more time, a lot of credit might not come in our way. If you think about design, your users and fellow developers will see benefits, working software, on-time released and a clear understandable code-base. <br/><br/>Chapter 8: Complexity<br/><br/>This is a common story in big projects. Someone working on a project would say, we were working on a project few years ago and this technology we were using was modern back then but it’s obsolete now. We can’t develop fast enough to keep up with modern user needs or while we were developing company x wrote a product better than ours much more quickly than we did. <br/><br/>If we think about this issue, what’s the source of this problem? Complexity. We start with a simple project that takes a month, but when we add complexity, it takes three months, if we add more, it takes nine months. Complexity builds upon complexity. In the first release, we don’t shoot for the moon, we start with something that works and doable. Adding Features is one way to add complexity to the software. Here are the most common ways: <br/><br/>1) Expanding the purpose of software <br/>2) Adding Programmers <br/>3) Changing things that don’t need to be changed <br/>4) Being locked into bad technologies <br/>5) Misunderstanding <br/>6) Poor Design or no design<br/>7) Reinventing the wheel, the only time we invent a wheel is when we need something that doesn’t exist, all of existing technologies are bad and will lock us in, existing wheels are incapable of meeting our needs, they aren’t properly maintained. <br/>We add all these, we get, “Never-Shipping” Product. <br/><br/>If our purpose of our software is to help users write, but then we add some other purpose to it, then it gets very complex quickly. The purpose of word processor is to help us write things. A user needs to understand the purpose of the software, he wants a purpose behind it like to help doing taxes. To make a user get angry, make it difficult for the user to accomplish their purpose. Sometimes marketing, sales would bring up purpose of a software is to be cool, edgy design, become popular but we’d need a technical director or software designer to take the responsibility of this. Users are happiest with a focused, simple product that never violates, it’s basic purpose. A Technology’s survived potential is linked with maintainability. To have a sense of it’s survivability, look at the recent release library. Another attribute is interoperability which is the ability to switch away from a technology if you have to decide with another technology. <br/><br/>We’d have to ask, what problems are we trying to solve? We should ask the question, how in general, in a perfect world, should this sort of problem be solved? We don’t ask, how does Professor Anne solve this in her program or how do I solve this using my code. <br/><br/>In order to handle complexity, we can redesign a system that is too complex into smaller steps. If it’s too complex, it will take a lot of effort and time, but we’d need to conceive of a system that is simpler than what we have now, but it’s important to keep releasing new features. Unless we do this, we won’t be keeping up with the amount of change. One of the best ways to handle writing features and complexity is to do our redesigning purely with goal of making some specific feature easier to implement and then implementing that feature. It’s helpful to know multiple programming languages, and be familiar with many different libraries, because it involves different ways of thinking about problems. <br/><br/>Chapter 9: Testing: <br/><br/>I believe that every software developer has faced this, the software is running now, there is no certainty that it will run in the future. The degree to which you know how your software behaves is the degree to which you have accurately tested it. <br/>When we say, it works, it’s vague. We should rather test our software so that it behaves in the way we intended it to be. We have to know what behavior we intended it to be. <br/><br/>Unless we have tried it, we don’t know that it works. We must ensure that our tests are accurate. The results of our tests show us that the features of the software to be valid. Usually testing is over-looked. Developers build automated tests for every piece of code that they write. <br/><br/>Let’s summarize the book in concise points: <br/>1) Purpose of software is to help people<br/>2) Equation of Software Design<br/>3) Law of Change which is longer our software exists, the more probable that any piece of it will have to change <br/>4) Law of defect probability: Chance of introducing a defect is proportional to size of changes you make to it<br/>5) Law of simplicity: Ease of maintenance  is proportional to simplicity of individual pieces. <br/>6) Law of Testing: The degree to which you know how your software behaves is the degree to which you have accurately tested it<br/><br/>The most important points are that it is important to reduce the effort of maintenance than to reduce the effort of implementation. The effort of implementation is proportional to complexity of the system.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

PM me if you want every chapter.<br/><br/>I am content with my approach and believe that in the next few iterative attempts, I will be able to articulate it better. I am drawn towards the field due to my love of Philosophy. <br/><br/><b><br/>Outline: <br/><br/>Chapter 1: Logic to Cognitive Science<br/>Chapter 2: Mathematical and computational Pre-requisite <br/>Chapter 3: Machine Learning Basics <br/>Chapter 4: Feed Forward Neural Network<br/>Chapter 5: Modification & Extnetila to Feed Forwads Neural Network<br/>Chapter 6: Convolutional Neural Network<br/>Chapter 7: Recurrent Neural Network<br/>Chapter 8: AutoEncodeers<br/>Chapter 9: Neural Language Models<br/>Chapter 10: Overview<br/>Chapter 11: Conclusion<br/></b><br/><br/><b> Chapter 1: Logic to Cognitive Science. </b><br/><br/>My own thoughts on this chapter is that, it is important to understand historical context to get a scoop of how beautiful, the field of Machine Learning arose to the modern scene of academics and industry.<br/> <br/>The key thoughts in this chapter are Good Old Fashion A.I, which concerns itself symbolic logic, mathematical precision against connectionism, that has cognitive science, psychology and philosophical predicates. <br/><br/>Using the former, Researchers were building expert systems and the later, we know that it is taking over modern systems in image recognition, computer vision, automated systems.  <br/><br/>Sandro Skansi says, Artificial Intelligence has its root under Leibniz. Leibniz is one of my favorite philosophers in history. Leibniz concealed two concepts, characteristica universalis and calculus ratiocinator. Characteristica universalis is an idealized language that can translate all science and any principles. calculus ratiocinator is the machine, whether software or hardware, you decide. <br/><br/>Deep Learning is the connectionist tribe using artificial neural network that has strongholds in some aspects of Artificial Intelligence. <br/><br/>This Chapter gives you a glimpse of how interdisciplinary the field of Deep Learning has been, from psychiatry, philosophy, mathematics and biology. AI research concerns mostly with understanding, modeling and formalizing the interactions of cognitive processes. <br/><br/>Sandro Skansi says Artificial Intelligence is Philosophical Engineering. <br/><br/>Why does he say this? Because, Artificial intelligence is trying to replicate intelligence. <br/><br/><b> Chapter 2: Mathematical and Computational Pre-Requisite: </b><br/><br/>I will try my best attempt to understand intuitiveness of concepts rather bore you with mathematical formalization. I believe mathematical formalization is important to learn to play and practice A.I. It is similar to a musician learning to play various types of music through understanding musical notations. I believe in my fourth or fifth iteration, I will bring you the magic of mathematical formalization. <br/><br/>I’m going to concise the important topics that are covered in this chapter. <br/><br/>The Main Engine of Deep Learning is Backpropagation. <br/><br/>Backpropagation consists of gradient descent and to move along a gradient. The Gradient is vector of derivations. <br/><br/>There’s many examples of vectors, matrices,  linear programming, concepts from statistical and probability theory in this Chapter. Finally, there’s also examples of Logic and Turing machines. Logic is foundation of mathematics, turning machine is the basic theoretical concept that a computing machine is built upon. If you come across Aristotle and until George Boole, you can get a fair understanding and evolution of it. <br/><br/>Skansi goes into a brief intro to Python Programming. This might be useful for non-CS majors. 	<br/><br/><br/><b> Chapter 3: Machine Learning Basics: </b><br/><br/>This Chapter is going to give basics in the field of Machine Learning. <br/><br/>Machine Learning is the subfield of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. <br/><br/>There’s three branches within Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Deep Learning is a special approach in Machine Learning that covers all branches and seeks to extend to other areas of Artificial Intelligence. <br/><br/>This Chapter has the following material: <br/><br/>a)	Elementary Classification: <br/>b)	Naive Bayesian Classifier:<br/>c)	A Simple Neural Network: Logistic Regression: <br/>d)	MNIST Dataset<br/>e)	Learning without Labels: K-Means<br/>f) Learning Language: bag of word representation<br/><br/>a) Elementary Classification: <br/><br/>Supervised learning is elementary classification. Consider the problem in an image classification, “is car” or “not car.” I ask the reader to get the book for understanding the details. <br/><br/>Evaluating Classification Results involve using confusion matrix, which has concepts of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative. <br/><br/>Categorical features are very common. Machine Learning algorithms cannot accept categorical features, eg: we have a column named Dog. We allow only binary values in the column, and convert it into 1 or 0. This is called one-hot encoding. <br/><br/>b) Naive Bayesian Classifier:<br/><br/>This uses basic bayesian classifier,  the core assumption is that variables are independent. Therefore, it cannot handle dependencies in features for classifier. <br/><br/>c) A Simple Neural Network: Logistic Regression: <br/><br/>This is an important concept that is going to help build our understanding of neural networks and deep learning. <br/><br/>Within Supervised learning, we divide it into two types, one is to predict a class, the next is predicting a value. For the first, we use naive bayesian classifier. For the second, predicting a value, we explore logistic regression. Logistic Regression is “not a regression algorithm but a classification algorithm.” Machine Learning community uses it as a classifier instead of regression model. <br/><br/>Logistic function is the main component of a logistic regression. If we think logistic regression as simple neural network, we are not committed to logistic function — in this, it is non-linearity, a component which enables complex behavior. <br/><br/>d) MNIST Dataset: <br/>MNIST Dataset is modification of national institute of standard consisting of handwritten digits. Geoffrey Hinton called MNIST the fruit fly of machine learning because a lot of research is performed on it. <br/><br/>e) Learning without Labels: K-Means<br/><br/>For two algorithms for unsupervised learning, there’s two algorithms here: PCA and K-means. <br/><br/>PCA represents a branch of unsupervised learning called distributed representations.It is one of the most important topics in deep learning. PCA is the most simple algorithm for building distributed representations. <br/><br/>Another algorithm called clustering, is similar to PCA. It captures similarity in n-dimensional space. <br/><br/>K-means is un supervised learning, which means there’s no labels or targets in the dataset. It produces clusters of data. <br/><br/>Correlation is when two data-points move together linearly or has similarity. For eg: People over 180 c.m are more likely to be above 80 kilos. If two features are highly correlated, then it is hard to tell them apart. <br/><br/>Ideally we want to find features which are not correlated that captures underlying component. In Statistics, it is called latent variables. On doing this, we are able to represent something called distributed representations. <br/><br/>Building distributed representation is the essence of what artificial neural networks do. Every layer builds own distributed representation and this facilitates learning. <br/><br/>f) Learning Language: bag of word representation<br/><br/>We have seen numerical features, ordinal features and categorical features. We explore Natural Language Processing. In it, it let’s dive into processing language by using a simple model, the bag of words.<br/><br/>In Natural Language Processing, we use terms like a corpus, fragments. A corpus is whole collection of texts we have, they can be composed into fragments. A fragment can be single sentence, paragraph or multi page documents. Fragment is what we use for training sample. Eg: A PhD Thesis is one fragment, if we analyze sentiment in social media, each comment is one fragment. <br/><br/><br/><b>Chapter 4: FeedForward Neural Networks: </b><br/><br/>As we saw in previous chapter, back propagation is the core method of learning in Deep Learning. I think, I did not explain what is Deep Learning in previous chapters. It is machine learning with deep artificial neural networks. In this chapter, we explore simple neural networks called feedforward neural networks. <br/><br/>A neural Network is made of simple basic elements in logistic regression. Logistic regression is the most simple neural network. <br/><br/>Every element that holds an input is called neuron. The logistic regression, then has a single point where all inputs are directed and this is its output. The difference in artificial neural network is that there is a hidden layer between input and output layer. <br/><br/>Every neuron is connected to all neurons of next layer, it might be multiplied by so called weight. The flow of information goes from first layer, second layer and third layer neurons. Different layers have different non-linearities. <br/><br/>We represent them in vectors and matrices. <br/><br/>Perceptron Rule: <br/><br/>Skanski says learning in neurons is updating of weights and biases during back propagation. An early procedure for artificial neurons is perceptron learning. It consists of binary threshold neuron (binary threshold units). Perceptron learning rule looks like a modificed logistic regression. <br/><br/>An example of Perceptron training would look like the following: <br/>- Choose training set<br/>- Predicted output matches output label, do nothing<br/>- If Perceptron prediction is 0, but if it should have predicted a 1, then add input vector to weight vector<br/>- If Perceptron prediction is 1, but if it should have predicted a 0, then subtract input vector from weight vector <br/><br/>Delta Rule: <br/><br/>The main issue in making multi layer perceptron is that it doesn’t know how to expend perceptron learning to work with multiple laters. <br/><br/>As it doesn’t know, the option seems to abandon but we mentioned a rule called back propagation. To explain this, Skansi gives an example of predicting price of a meal over repeated buys. <br/><br/>We want to find true price of a meal across a time using weights. In this, the learning rate controls how much error is handed when individual weights are to be updated. It is capable of learning weights across layers. <br/><br/>From Logistic Neuron to Back propagation:<br/><br/>Delta rule works for a simple neuron called linear neuron. To make the delta rule work, we would need a function that measures if we got the result right, if not, by how much did we miss. It is called error function or cost function. <br/><br/>We use derivatives to learn weights of logistic neuron. <br/><br/>Back propagation: <br/><br/>Back propagation is using derivatives to learn weights of logistic neuron, except that it is applying more than once to back propagate the errors through layers. <br/><br/>Back propagation of error is basically gradient descent. Gradient descent is optimization algorithm for finding minimum of a function. But we bump into issues: it takes too long time, second by changing weights, we will not find out whether a combination of them would work better. <br/><br/>While first of these problems can be overcome by gradient descent, the second is only partially resolved. It is usually called local optima. The third problem is near the end of learning, the changes will be too small. Back propagation also has this problem, and it is usually solved by using dynamic learning rate which gets smaller through learning progresses. We get a method called, finite difference approximation. <br/><br/>In the hidden layer of neural network, we have randomly initialized weights and raises, multiply them with inputs, add them together and take them through logistic regression which flattens them to a value between 0 and 1. We do it one more time. At the end, we get a value between 0 and 1 from logistic neuron in output layer. Everything below 0.5 is 1 0 and above is 1. <br/><br/>In doing many passes, we find that error has decreased. Next is an example of Python script for shopping basket classification of users abandoning it. <br/><br/><b> Chapter 5: Modifications and Extensions to a Feed-Forward Neural Network:</b><br/><br/>If we have a classifier in 2D space, the classifier draws a very straight line, then we have one with high bias. This can generalize well, the classifier for new points (test error) will be similar to old points (training error). This is called under fitting. On the other hand, if the classifier draws an intricate line to include every X and none of Os (Consider X and O as classes), then we have high variance ( low bias) which is called overfitting. <br/><br/>Emprically we want to land somewhere between over fitting and under fitting. The approach to take to find this is called regularization. <br/><br/><b> Chapter 6: Convolutional Neural Networks: </b><br/><br/>Convolutional Neural Networks were invented by Yann LeCun. It was built by ideas of David Hubel and Torstein presented in 1968, which won them Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine. <br/><br/>They discovered receptive field, which is used to describe between parts of visual fields and individual neurons which processes the information. <br/><br/>The step to building convolutional network is flattening images (2D arrays) to vectors. The second step is one that will take image vector to single workhorse neural which will be in charge of processing. We use logistic regression for this, but we use a different activation function, although structure remains the same. <br/><br/>A convolutional neural network is a neural network that has one or more convolutional layers. <br/><br/>Skanski then gives a full example of building a convolutional neural network using Keras in Python. On using it, we can classify text as it is setup for pattern recognition in images. <br/><br/><b> Not enough space to post other chapters </b><br/><br/><b> Chapter 11: Conclusion </b><br/><br/>Sandro brings quite intriguing point within A.I community, Connectionist and Good Old Fashion A.I. <br/><br/>He says, Connectionism under the name Deep Learning is trying to take over Good Old Fashion A.I.<br/><br/>A Sculptor has two things, a clear and precise idea what to make, skill and tools to make it. <br/><br/>Sandro says reach out to Philosophy for ideas, when you have no tools, reach out to mathematics. <br/><br/>An extraordinary way to finish the book. I do love philosophy and desire to establish within the field of Artificial intelligence for my career.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this to Researchers or anyone who wants to get into Deep Learning<br/><br/>Deus Vult, <br/>Gottfried",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I'm from Tamil Nadu, India. I've lived in the West and constantly have questions about, Why the West is better?<br/><br/>Parthasarathi's book is laid out in the following way: <br/><br/><b> Outline: <br/><br/>The Great Divergence: <br/>Part I: Setting the Stage: Europe and Asia before divergence<br/>Part II: Divergence of Britain <br/>Part III: Indian Path: </b><br/><br/><b><br/>Part I:<br/>Introduction: </b><br/><br/>Parthasarathy starts with saying that there were pressures faced in Britain. The Pressures involved competition in cotton industry, invention of steam engine, availability of coal<br/><br/>Parthasarathi introduces how various scholar’s have approached to Great Divergence. There’s three approaches to Great Divergence: <br/><br/>-First one involves, Property Rights (Asian rulers were despotic and could usurp anyone’s property)<br/>-Second one is European Population lower and ability to gain more capital (Malthusian)<br/>-Last one is Max Weber’s Protestant Work ethic (European Rationality) <br/><br/>Parthasarathi challenges european Scientific Culture and uniqueness. He says there were significant activity of Indian Intellectual life in 1800’s. <br/><br/>My own personal thoughts are: Yes, but what did they do? I think, on military wise, Tippu Sultan might have had his economy, military upgrade from French. This happens throughout history. French were hiring English skilled artisans, clock-makers during a time period. Within Tippu’s empire, Indians combined both European and Indian (local) knowledge. They wanted to understand nature. <br/><br/>Parthasarathi qutoes Edward Said’s Orientalism. He said, Said provided thoughts about Asia being not different from Europe. In-fact few scholars perpetuated the difference as, Asia, “other”. Parthasarathi disagrees. He says for Karl Marx, it is capitalism that provided divergence between Europe and Asia. <br/><br/>Parthasarathi argues we must not apply anachronism by fitting parts of history. Many bring categories of industrialization, social concepts before 18th century. In-fact some categories were not developed before 18th century. I think, this is true. As a lay-reader, I might fall into anachronism. <br/><br/><b>Part I:  -Setting the Stage: <br/>	-India and the global economy, 1600–1800<br/>	-Political institutions and economic life </b><br/><br/>In this Chapter, Parthasarathi wants to explore and set historical state before getting into his key question, “Why Europe grew richer?”. <br/><br/>Parthasarathi  quotes Immanuel Wallerstein, the American Sociologist and Economic historian. Wallerstein says, “The modern world-system took the form of a capitalist world-economy that had its genesis in Europe in the long sixteenth century . . . Since that time the capitalist world-economy has geographically expanded to cover the entire globe.”<br/><br/>As Wallerstein, most scholars believed that in Europe, had its center for Capitalism. <br/>K. N. Chaudhuri, a historian from Birkbeck college, England showed that mercantile sophistication and commercial dynamism predated before the arrival of European merchants. <br/><br/>In 19th century, China and India were hubs of economic activity. China exported porcelain and Silk. This made China incredibly wealthy. India exported cotton to the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Parthasarathy says, India clothed the world. China was more critical that it monopolized world’s output of silver. He says that he is not there to replace Frank’s Sinocentric global system with an Indo-centric version. Sinocentric Global System means, China was the center of Global affairs, superior to every other country. <br/><br/>Before the 17th century - India’s market for cotton included Indian Ocean and regions close to it. Indian cotton were in demand and were readily accepted in Europe. Indian cottons were essential for slaves in slave trade (French slave trade). <br/><br/>Prathasarathi says another market for Indian Cotton was Americas. The Creativity and talent of Indian cotton cloth manufacturers were unsurpassed by anyone in the world. He says that there was a common belief that it was due to low wages in India for cotton manufacturing, they succeeded. <br/><br/>He gives some evidence arguing against this commonly held belief. Indian cotton was consumed around four corners of the world. As incomes and revenues grew in India, many around the Globe tried to imitate it. Britain successfully surpassed it through innovating with their inventions. <br/><br/>K.N Chaudhuri says, Indian manufacturing involved surplus labor leading to low wages. He says there’s not much evidence that productivity of India was higher than that of Britain. It was around 1760’s, new inventions improved spinning in Britain. He goes into details of A’in-i Akbari giving price and wage data on Mughal India. He says, calico weavers earned more than laborers in agriculture. Parthasarathy quotes, Robert C Allen, a british historian who wrote numerous works around Industrial revolution. <br/><br/>Allen’s conclusion was that standards of living were lower in India. He says, this has been challenged on the basis of voluminous data on prices and income collected by Francis Buchanan. Francis Buchanan was a Scottish Physician who made numerous contributions to zoology, botany and geograpgy while living in India. He surveyed several districts of South India around early 19th century. He called, Tippu Sultan, a wonderful projector, and reported that Mysore had succeeded in manufacturing “broad-cloth, paper formed on wires like the European kind, watches, and cutlery. <br/><br/><b> 3: Political Institutions and Economic Life: </b><br/><br/>In Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith shared that nations of Europe were most prosperous. China and India had become stagnant. French physician, Francois Bernier provided an account of Mughal Empire travels. In Francois works, he mentioned that rulers oppressed their people, deprived of their rights and fruits of their labor. Montesquie read this account and wrote laws, customs, manners of orient remain unchanging.<br/><br/>Thomas Malthus argued that checks and balances in society involves famine, diseases to arrest human demographics. This would cause flourishing at times due to controlling Over Population. <br/><br/>He adds and says that Karl Marx, could write with great authority about Indian Society. He says, “Indian society has no history at all, at least no known history. What we call its history, is but the history of the successive intruders who founded their empires on the passive basis of that unresisting and unchanging society.”<br/><br/>In 20th century, In addition to the above two arguments, Max Weber added rationality to the list for divergence between Europeans and Asia. Here Parthasarathy is exploring these assumptions from Weber, He says Indian sub-continent is not different from Europe. Despotic ruler idea originated from Machiavelli’s book on Ottoman Empire, the entire region is controlled by one Master, and everyone else is his slave. <br/><br/>Due to Despotism, agricultures would not invest more in expanding their enterprise, merchants hid their investments and capitals because the Mughal empire owned everything. Parthasarathy has been trying to rebut European arguments against Asia throughout the book.<br/><br/>Irfan Habib, an Indian historian has offered a classic description from Mughal India: “It was inevitable that the actual burden on the peasantry should became so heavy in some areas as to encroach upon their means of survival. Parthasarathy says the despotic view has been discredited. Mughals were, King of Kings. They were power brokers who negotiated with Zamindars and other Local Rulers throughout India.<br/><br/>Parthasarathy clears my doubt about rest of India, it seems like King was extremely wealthy and others did not have a good quality of life. He says, Adam Smith’s critique of India was due to Caste System, most of labor stock had to stick with same occupation. <br/><br/>All Son's followed their Father’s occupation due to Caste, as a result there was no social-mobility. However, Parthasarathy says there were cases in 18th century, that there was mobility among occupations. He disagrees about Caste being a rigid structure and quotes  Gholam Hossein Khan. He is an Indian Historian employed in English East India Company around 1780-1810 in Bengal. He lamented the lower caste. They, the lower caste members were becoming politically prominent. This was evidence of social mobility, availability of talent and money.<br/><br/>Parthasarathy says property rights were also not as insecure as Francois Berner (French physician, 1615-1679) & Adam Smith claimed to be in Asia. Funds were transferred through hundi and line of credit system. Karen Leonard argued that decline of Mughal Empire was due to less banking support. <br/><br/><b>Part II — Divergence of Britain: <br/>-European Response to Indian Cotton<br/>-State and market: Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire<br/>-From cotton to coal </b><br/><br/>In Part II, Parthasarathy examines what made Britain lead ahead of India. He says, various powers had failed to protect their local economics or even think about the challenges from Indian cotton market or industry. In 1830’s British Cotton Industry caught up with Indian sub-continent. They had adopted coal. Wide adoption of Coal started to take off across various industries in Britain. Parthasarathy goes into details of Cotton industry giving various levels of accounting for exports. I think you can skip this chapter unless you want to know with extreme depth about various categories of Cotton.<br/><br/><b>Part III – The Indian Path<br/>	-Science and Technology in India, 1600-1800<br/>	-Modern Industry in early nineteenth-century India<br/>	-Conclusion </b><br/><br/>Why Science was not in Asia? He says, development of science was key for industrialization in Europe. He quotes Joseph Needham. Joseph Needham, a Sino Scholar from England had written volumes of books examining Science in China. What did Science rise from? He says, experimentation and belief that the natural world is intelligible. <br/><br/>In 17th and 18th century, Indian Sciences made important contributions to Astronomy and Mathematics. He says the Taj Mahal and other monuments during Mughal Empire were impressive. It was an evidence of activities of Science. These architectural masterpieces . . . would not have been possible had Jahangir not encouraged this family of geometers to develop their trigonometric skills into architecture.” Raja Jai Singh, King of Rajput Amber, sponsored Astronomy in India.<br/><br/>Parthasarathy had quoted William Hunter, a Scottish Physicist, Anatomist in earlier chapters.<br/>He says, Tippu Sultan had financed important works in Science within his Kingdom. In Tanjore, Sarasvati Mahal Library was an important library. Tanjore was in Tamil Nadu, India. It was ruled by Serfoji, a King. Serfojji “quotes Fourcroy, Lavoisier, Linnaeus, and Buffon fluently. <br/><br/>The Greatest Library in North India was located in Lucknow, Uttar Pradhesh. He says, Awadh was center of Islamic rational science. A French – Polymath, Claude Martin helped to transfer European knowledge in Awadh. After British Conquest, patronage stopped and erased Science from India. <br/>European visitors to the Mughal Emperor’s court were struck by what one Jesuit described as a delight in the “mechanical arts.” Akbar is credited with several inventions, including a method for the construction of prefabricated, multi- story buildings from iron and wood.<br/><br/>Parthasarathy says, Shipbuilding was of high quality around 19th century in India. In 1811, a storm off the coast in Madras gives evidence for quality of ships in India. There were advances in Rocketry. Mysorean Rockets first under Hyder Ali and his Son, Tippu Sultan were used against British English East India Company. The success of these South Indian rockets inspired William Congreve to experiment with the Mysorean designs in the Woolwich Arsenal in London.<br/><br/>To conclude, In terms of knowledge and technique, In the eighteenth century Indian workers were by no means inferior to those found in Britain or elsewhere in Europe. For more than a hundred years the reasons for the limited industrial development of nineteenth-century India have been debated. <br/><br/>Externalists place primary responsibility upon British colonialism in the subcontinent. Internalists give primacy to social, cultural or economic conditions within India. In this vein, British economist Vera Anstey and Indian historian, Tirthankar Roy fall under internalist camp. <br/><br/>In finishing this book, I see that Christopher Bayly (British Historian specializing in British Imperial history) has been quoted the most across all chapters. The English East India Company ruled India on a profit–loss basis. Around 1850’s and since then, quality of skills, capital fell in India. As the English ran on profit-loss basis, they did not want to invest in Education as it would threaten their superiority. It was also the case that without state assistance of some kind – and the form that this took varied widely from place to place – industrialization was impossible. <br/><br/><b>We can summarize that, Parthasarathy’s answer to Great Divergence, “Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia did not Grow Rich” is due to lack of right state policies and responses to external pressures. </b><br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in West vs East, India, English East India Company, Interest in Economic History. <br/><br/>Deus Vult, <br/>Gottfreid",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It gives the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with least amount of ink space. It consists of communicating complex ideas communicated with clarify, precision and efficiency. <br/><br/>	- It is about clarity in communicating with precision, efficiency that shows data, induce user to think about substance of visualization, avoid distortion, present many numbers in small space, make large datasets coherent, encourage eye to compare various pieces of data, reveal data at several layers of detail, serve clear purpose, be closely integrated with statistical and verbal description of data. <br/><br/>Graphics reveal about data.<br/>		<br/>-Every Graph or Visualization should let the user to think about the data, not the methodology or technique<br/>		-Time Series Data<br/><br/>Two Greatest Scientist of Modern Graphical Design are J.H Lambert, Swiss German Mathematician and William Playfair, Scottish political economist. <br/>Playfair preferred Graphics. <br/><br/>		-Descriptive Chronology is not casual expression. <br/><br/>Charles Minard, the French Engineer who explained Napoleon’s army — combination of data-map and time series. <br/><br/>Most Modern Graphics are relational — x, y that encourages to find out casual relationship. <br/><br/><b> Part 1 — 2) Graphical Practice: Graphical Integrity: </b><br/>	<br/>For many of us, we constantly think of lies when we look at a graphic or statistic. <br/>Around 1960, John Turkey made Graphical Practice respectable.<br/><br/>What is distortion in Data Graphic?<br/><br/>		Lie Factor = size of effect shown in graphic/ size of effect in data<br/>		If it’s greater than 1.05 and less than .95, then it’s substantial <br/><br/>		Show data variation not design variation. <br/><br/>		Context is important for Graphical Integrity — compared to what?<br/><br/>Lying Graphic cheapen graphical art everywhere. <br/><br/><b> <i><br/>The Six principles of Graphical Integrity: <br/><br/>- Representation of numbers present in the graphic should be directly proportional to numerical quantities reported<br/>- Clear, detailed and thorough labeling should be used to defeat graphical distortions and ambiguity <br/>- Show data variations, not design variations <br/>- In time series display, use standardized monetary units<br/>- The number of information carrying dimensions should not exceed number of dimensions in data<br/>	- Graphics must not quote data out of context<br/><br/></b> </i><br/><br/><b> Part 1 —3)  Graphical Practice:  Sources of Graphical Integrity and Sophistication </b><br/>	<br/>	Why do they lie? <br/>          -Lack of Quantitive skills, the doctrine that statistical data is boring<br/><br/>Many believe that graphics are there to entertain unsophisticated readers. Japan has the highest use of statistical graphics in their newspaper. <br/>	<br/><b> Part II — 1)	Theory of Data Graphics: Data Ink and Graphical Redesign: </b><br/><br/>Data Graphics should draw viewers attention to substance of data. It should form quantitive contents. <br/><br/>Fundamental principle is, “Above all else, show the data.” This is the principle for a theory of data graphics. <br/><br/>Data Ink ratio is data ink/total ink used in graphic. Remember to maximize the data ink ratio devoted to the data. Other side of data ink ratio is to erase non-data-ink, within reason. <br/><br/><br/><b> <i><br/>There’s five principles in theory of data graphics produce substantial changes in graphical design. <br/>	-Above all else show the data<br/>	-Maximize the data-ink ratio<br/>	-Erase non-data-ink <br/>	-Erase redundant data-ink <br/>	-Revise and edit <br/><br/></b> </i><br/><b> Part II — 1)	Theory of Data Graphics:  Chartjunk, Vibrations, Grids and Duck </b><br/><br/>	Interior decoration of a graphic produces a lot of raw ink that does not tell the viewer anything new. The Grid might include a lot of chart-junk. <br/><br/>When Graphics are taken over design or styles rather than quantitative data, it is called as Big Duck. <br/><br/><b> Part II — 2)	Theory of Data Graphics: Data Ink Maximization and Graphical Design. </b><br/>	<br/>	Reducing ink ratio in some of the charts might induce changes. <br/><br/><b> Part II — 3)	Theory of Data Graphics: Multifunctioning Graphical Elements </b><br/><br/>The Same Ink should be used for more than one graphical purpose, it carries data information and performs a design function usually left to non-data-ink. Data based grid is shrewd graphical devise. <br/><br/>Sometimes, the puzzle and hierarchy of multifunctioning graphical elements can data graphics into visual puzzles, crypto graphical mysteries. Colors sometimes generate graphical puzzles. The shades of gray gives us more easier comprehension. This is the key. <br/><br/><b> Part II — 4)	Theory of Data Graphics: Data Density and Small Multiples </b><br/><br/>How many statistical graphics take advantage of ability to detect large amounts of information in small space? Let’s begin with empirical measure of graphical performance and data density. <br/><br/>Data density of graphic = number of entries in data matrix / area of data graphic <br/><br/>More information is better than less information. Maximize data density and size of data matrix within reason. High volume data must be designed with care. The cost of chart junk, non-data-ink, and redundant data-ink is even more costly in data rich design. We apply shrink principle, which means graphics can be shrunk way down. Bertin’s crisp and elegant line displays small scale graphics in a single page. <br/><br/>Small Multiples, resemble frame of movies, series of graphs, series combination of variables. <br/><br/><br/><b> <i><br/>A Well designed Small Multiple will contain: <br/><br/>	- inevitability comparative <br/>	- deftly multivariate <br/>	- shrunken high density graphics <br/>	- based on large matrix <br/>	- drawn exclusively with data ink <br/>	- efficient in interpretation<br/>	- often narrative in content. <br/><br/><br/></b> </i><br/><b> Part III — Theory of Data Graphics: 1)	Aesthetic and Technique in Data Graphical Design: </b><br/><br/>	-Graphical Elegance is often found in simplicity of design and complexity of data<br/><br/>Visually attractive graphics gather power from content. Basic structure for showing data are sentence, table and graphic. Often two or three of this should be combined. Make Complexity accessible. <br/><br/>Graphics should prefer towards horizontal, greater in length than height. <br/>Lines in Data Graphic should be thin. Graphical elements look better when their proportions are in balance. <br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I am a casual yet extremely curious observer of other-cultures. I wish, I could hear what a scholar who grew up in the Middle East comment on this society. A Scholar who has lived in both worlds.<br/><br/>Oh, I can think of Patrick Smith who wrote a book on, ""Somebody Else's Century."" He's a Westerner living in Asia (China, Japan, India). He was able to understand Asia (China, Japan, India) far more than any Westerner that I have encountered. <br/><br/>Patrick was more aware of intricate social concepts which are absent in the West. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this book to learn about Saudi Arabia. I am not sure what to recommend. <br/><br/>Deus Vult, <br/>Gottfried",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Ergo, he takes Theism to be necessary for Science at all. I was surprised to find Swinburne's different theological views.

However, I was surprised to find they were reluctant but they took the responsibility of helping them in every area of life. <br/><br/>The author has a vast array of citations, talked to a lot of people. It's a good book to find a reference for sources on Caste issues in Tamil Nadu from 1880's. <br/><br/>You might like this book if you are a scholar, and want to learn about Pariah Problem. <br/><br/>--Deus Vult<br/>Gottfried<br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Merchant banking castes were vital to South Indian economy during 1700’s to 1950’s. <br/><br/>The author — Anthropologist and scholar, David West Rudner, focuses on the Nakarattars of Tamil Nadu, also known as Chettiars. <br/><br/>Chettiars are located in Chettinad area or specifically around Karaikudi, Chidambaram, Pudukottai town in Tamil Nadu.<br/><br/>The Book is laid out into three parts: <br/><b><i><br/>Part 1) Concepts<br/>Part 2) Business<br/>Part 3) Ritual and Kinship<br/></b></i><br/><b><u>Part 1 - Concept:</u></b> <br/><br/>Caste is characteristic unit of Indian Social Organization. Nakarattar caste were primarily mercantile bankers. They started with salt trading as their occupation. Around 1760’s salt trading was unprofitable so they entered money-lending trade. <br/><br/>Occupationally — they played a middle role between Colonial British Government and local agrarian-communities in Tamil Nadu. Nakarattars monopolized marketshare of money lending as their financial instrument. Mainly, they focused on family, business and God (saivism) <br/><br/>Surprisingly — had no other South Indian competitors in major markets. Through their business enterprises, acting as an extension of family kinship, they could scale and diversify into markets like Ceylon, Burma, Madras, Malaya. Nakarattars were primarily economic than political. <br/><br/>Within the field of Anthropology, among South Indian Castes, every caste occupied a trade and specialized occupation. They played considerable role in financial, political role in early 20th century madras presidency. <br/><br/>David West Rudner, argues that Nagarattars are an argument against the famous Sociologist, Max Webers theory on incompatibility of Hinduism and Capitalism. Nagarattars functioned as communal capitalists. <br/><br/>One could say — caste is symbolic capital. Symbolic capital is an anthropological concept. It captures how sociological relationships function for an individual in society. An individual has access to resources such as capital, human labor, kin groups based on honor, prestige, recognition. <br/><br/>Through symbolical capital, an individual belonging to a caste could concretely mobilize as political factions to achieve a specific outcome. Castes do not have specific rights through symbolic capital. They are temporary social extended kin groups. <br/><br/><b><u>Part 2 - Business: </u></b> <br/><br/>This Chapter focuses on specific details on cavities of nagarattar business entities in Tamil Nadu, Ceylon, Burma, Malaya. <br/><br/>Nagarattar’s business financial statement gives a detailed picture of their community. The chapter goes into specific details on balance sheet, income statement, affluence of nagarattars. They extended their philanthropic activity in making religious gift to construct temples among their community. <br/><br/>During 17th-19th century, India was the largest manufacturer of advanced goods, i.e. Textiles. They controlled 24% of world’s gross domestic product. <br/><br/>Nagarattar’s built their commercial empire out of complex network of interdependent family business firms lending money to business. Along with their profit making intention, went hand in hand with moral good. <br/><br/><u><b> Part 3 - Ritual and Kinship:</u></b> <br/><br/>In Ritual and Kinship, David focuses on Dravidian kinship marriages. He goes in depth into various kinship and customs. If you are a non-Tamil or non-South Indian reader, this chapter might be fascinating to you. Many of the kinship concepts do not extend as the same in Western world. Dravidian communities have customs in marriage with relatives, extended relatives, caste groups. Trust was essential ingredient. He says marriage was a negotiation between two descent groups.<br/><br/>A Nagarattar boy was trained from young age in basic numeric, multiplication, accounting in the context of skills required for money lending and banking.<br/>Around teenage years, he would work as an apprentice in one of the family firms. Once he finished back, he was ready to get married, and take responsibility of leading the business step by step. <br/><br/>David West Rudner gives specific examples of famous Nagarattars. A notable one is Annamalai Chettiar, who founded Annamalai University in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu. He was impressed by British Education. <br/><br/>Politically in early 20th century, Justice Party in Tamil Nadu played an important role in Tamil patriotism. Nagarattars involved actively in Madras Presidency during this time. Raja Muttiah played important role in portraying Congress party, or party of Mahatma Gandhi as North Indian Brahmins. Northern Aggression or Hindi imposition would be upon Tamil people. Thus, Justice Party gained respect among Tamil people. They preferred British rule over Congress. <br/><br/>Finally, Nagarattar’s influence extended to Indian Bank, Imperial Bank, Reserve Bank of India.<br/><br/>Deus Vult,<br/>Gottfried",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I recommend this to people interested in Law, Computer Science, Businesses. Almost all business are collecting information.<br/><br/>The meat of the book is applying Federal Constitutional Law specifically First, Third, Fourth and Fifth I have described in details in the following paragraphs. The following is how the book is organized: <br/><br/>1) Overview of Privacy Law<br/>2) Privacy Law in Media<br/>3) Law of domestic law enforcement <br/>4) National Security Law<br/>5) HIPAA<br/>6) Government Records <br/>7) Financial Data<br/>8) Consumer Data<br/>9) Data Security <br/>10) Education Privacy <br/>11) Employment Privacy<br/>12) International Privacy Law <br/><br/>Let me add some key definitions for non-legal person so that they can understand and add their vocabulary: <br/><br/>Tort: Tort is infringement upon a right leading to a liability<br/>False Light: False Light is similar to defamation (act of ruining someone’s name)<br/>Statute: A law established by legal body<br/><br/>Example: (Late) Jayalalitha was the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. She was in this position for approximately 20 years. She frequently used defamation law in Tamil Nadu. This was to bring people to court. It was a way to portray public power, protect her honor and image. In this way, she was in power. In False light, the plaintiff (person who brings someone to court) proves that the defendant (accused) published false information. <br/><br/>The First Chapter of the book goes into types of Privacy Law: <br/><br/>The types of privacy law in this chapter is organized into Federal Constitutional Law, State Constitutional Law and International Law. <br/><br/>Torts: Tort law is usually state law. Most torts involve an invasion of Privacy case. Invasion of privacy is broad term. <br/><br/>The book narrows down into public disclosure of private facts, intrusion upon seclusion, false light, appropriation of name.<br/><br/>Torts commonly involved in privacy cases: <br/><br/>a) Breach of Confidentiality<br/>b) Intentional infliction of Emotional Distress<br/>c) Defamation (Libel and Slander) <br/>d) Negligence <br/>e) Criminal Law — Peeping Tom activity <br/><br/>Federal Constitutional Law: <br/><br/>In Federal Constitutional Law, laws that are guaranteed within United States as a country. <br/>Following are the ways, U.S Constitution protects privacy of its citizens: <br/><br/>1) First Amendment, the right to speak anonymously <br/>First Amendment gives the right to freedom of association. This protects privacy of one’s associations <br/>2) Third Amendment’s protection of home from quartering of troops (I believe this is from the famous example of English troops gathering inside American houses)<br/>3) Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. <br/>4)Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination <br/>Constitutional right to privacy <br/>Constitutional right to information privacy <br/><br/>State Constitutional Law: <br/><br/>This means, laws that are guaranteed within a state in United States. <br/>Eg: California Const 1: “All people are by their nature free and independent, have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possession, and protecting property and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness and privacy”<br/><br/>Federal Statutory Law: This is law written by law makers in legislative body. It’s up to judiciary (courts) to interpret them. The Book gives about 20-30 examples like Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1947, protects the privacy of school records. <br/><br/>State Statutory Law: <br/><br/>Much of privacy law is found in state law. Privacy tort law and data breach are state law. Areas of State Legislation on Privacy are<br/>Law Enforcement (Wiretapping, electronic surveillance) <br/>Medical and Genetic information (Medical records)<br/>Government Records<br/>Financial Privacy <br/>Consumer Data and Business Records (Spam, Spyware, Telecommunications privacy, pretexting, use of SSN, data disposal, video privacy, RFID tracking devises, unauthorized access to computers and networks, restrictions on ISPs<br/>Data Security (identity theft and data security breach notification)<br/>Employment (State employee personal information, applications)<br/><br/>International Law: <br/><br/>Two approaches: <br/>1) Omnibus is comprehensive approach for public and private sector<br/>2) Sectoral: Each industry would have case by case statues<br/><br/>First Omnibus was designed by Europeans. Most countries adopted European omnibus approach. <br/><br/>Chief Privacy Officer: CPO is mainstay at many large organizations. CPO’s functions are as follows, employees are trained about privacy, the company is complying with the law. Lastly in this chapter, there’s a broad history of privacy law. <br/><br/>Chapter two talks about privacy and media: <br/><br/>States recognize privacy torts. They have application in variety of contexts. The Chapter gives examples of state laws and specific cases. <br/><br/>Chapter three is about Privacy and Law Enforcement: <br/><br/>This Chapter is based on the fourth amendment. The fourth amendment gives protection against unreasonable searches and seizers. This law is complex and not straightforward. In some cases, federal or state government can access people’s records. <br/><br/>Fourth amendment regulates domestic criminal investigations and national security investigations. Foreign intelligence gathering remains open. In short form, FISA is the main statute. Within fourth amendment, there’s three categories: <br/><br/>a) Criminal investigations, <br/>b) Domestic national security investigation<br/>c) Foreign intelligence gathering. <br/><br/>The chapter gives details about leading cases that involves fourth amendment. Some of the Intelligence agencies involved are FBI, CIA, NSA. <br/><br/><br/>Chapter five is about health privacy:<br/><br/>In this chapter, HIPAA is most comprehensive and strictest privacy regulation. <br/>Physicians and psychotherapists need to walk a fine line when dealing with confidentiality of patient. They could poses danger to others. Physicians cannot reveal confidential communication or information without consent of the patient, unless required by law. <br/><br/>They enjoy Physician-Patient Privilege, Psychotherapist-Patient Privilege. When the physician reveals patient’s confidential information, patient can bring a tort action as a beach of confidentiality. <br/><br/>Many states have specific statutes providing criminal and civil protections against disclosure of medical information. HIPPA doesn’t place restriction on de-identify data. De identified data  means, a data which is not personally identifiable. This chapter gives many instances of cases where Government has fined private companies due to HIPPA violation. Also, the fourth amendment protects individual genetic data from Government officials seeking to obtain it. <br/><br/>Chapter 6 is about Government records: <br/><br/>Federal Agency have constitutional duties to make information available to public and to protect privacy of people’s data. Fair Information Practices was issued by US Department of Health, Education and Welfare. <br/><br/>FIPs is embodied throughout U.S privacy statutes. Under Common law, U.S Supreme Court concluded that public could access court records. What to release as public or say, privacy of court record is within the discretion of train court judges. <br/><br/>Privacy Act of 1974 applies to federal agencies. It does not apply to business, private sector organizations, courts, state or local government. It protects citizens and lawfully admitted aliens. <br/><br/>Chapter 7 is about Financial Data: <br/><br/>Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 regulates consumer reporting industry and provides privacy right in consumer reports. <br/><br/>An employer seeks a consumer report for employment purposes, he or she must disclose in writing to authorize that the report can be obtained. <br/><br/>This is in the context that this information would not violate equal employment opportunity. FCRA enforcement has played in United States vs Spokeo, a data broker which sold marketing consumer profiles to employers without complying with FCRA. <br/><br/>HireRight, an employment background screening company was subjected to FCRA because its reports are consumer reports. Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 protects customer records at financial institutions from federal government access. <br/><br/>Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 requires financial institutions to asset federal government agency to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by detecting and reporting potentially suspicious activity. <br/><br/>Chapter 8 is about Consumer Data: <br/><br/>Federal laws regulate business data and consumer privacy offering different kinds of protections. The ways to safeguard are opt out rules vs opt in rules. <br/><br/>FTC plays an essential role in policing privacy practices of companies. Personally Identifiable Information is one of the most central concepts in privacy regulation. PII is any uniqueness in the data that can be used to identify a person.It defines scope and boundaries of privacy statues and regulations. <br/><br/>Basic assumption about consumer data is that in absence of PII, there is no privacy harm. Thus privacy regulation focuses on collection, use and disclosure of PII and leaves non-PII unregulated. <br/><br/>There are three ways to approach PII:<br/><br/>a) Tautological Approach - defines PII as any information that identifies a person<br/>b) Nonpublic approach - defines PII as any non public information or non aggregate data eg: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Cable Act<br/>c) Specific-types approach: defines PII by listing specific types of data that constitute PII Examples: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act regulates collection and use of children’s information by internet websites by requiring parental consent. <br/><br/>Some of the leading cases that involve consumer privacy includes companies like Google, Apple, Facebook. In Fradley v Facebook, the case was concerned about facebook feature called sponsored stories. <br/><br/>Plaintiff alleged a coherent theory of how they were economically injuring misappropriation of their names, photographs and likeness for use in paid commercial endorsement. This was targeted not at themselves but at other consumers. The Judge requested more information. In August 2013, court approved $20 million settlement with Facebook. <br/><br/>Contract and Promissory estoppel: <br/><br/>Privacy policies that make promises about privacy.  Consumers rely upon these privacy policies. This comes under contract and promissory estoppel. <br/><br/>Let me try to explain Promissory estoppel. It means, In the law of contracts, the doctrine that provides that if a party changes his or her position substantially either by acting or forbearing from acting. <br/><br/>To establish, Beach of contract, plaintiff must prove, existence of contract, breach of contract, damages that flow from the breach.<br/><br/>Are Privacy Policies Contracts? <br/><br/>Few courts have addressed this question. They agreed that privacy policies are not contracts. Google agreed to pay $22.5 million fine to FTC based on the charge that it violated its promises placed on tracking cookie on computers of safari users. <br/><br/>Telecommunication act requires telecommunication carrier to protect confidentiality of proprietary information and data relating to customers. <br/>Telephone consumer protection Act of 1991 permits people to stop unwanted telemarketing calls. <br/><br/>Computer Fraud and Abuse act prevents unauthorized access to computers. There are cases where people have been fined due to unauthorized access to someone else’s computer. <br/><br/>LVRC Holdings vs Brekka is an example case. Brekka was an employee. He emailed files to himself from workplace computer before he was to leave the office. He did not access the computer without authorization since he originally had permission to use the computer. Majority of courts summarized that he had authorized rights until his employer revoked his employment. Many states have mini FTC that enforces unfair and deceptive and practices act. <br/><br/>States have laws restricting use of RFID devices.In California, Eraser or Right to be Forgotten laws are included in privacy rights for California minors in digital world act. <br/><br/>In Illinois, Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act requires companies to obtain individual consent before collecting or disclosing biometric identifiers. <br/><br/>California online privacy protection act enforces that operators must post noticeable privacy policy on their websites that describes PII being collected, how it will be shared with third parties. <br/><br/>This is in the context of marketing departments for companies. Several states have anti spyware laws. Another California law prohibits unauthorized user from willfully loading software into the computer of California resident and using the software to carry out number of forbidden activities. Iowa, Texas, Washington have similar privacy laws. <br/><br/><br/>Chapter 9  talks about Data Security:<br/><br/>This chapter talks about Data Security. In United States, all states have enacted data breach notification statues. These laws contain important differences that make multistage notifications complex undertakings. FTC brought about 60 enforcement actions concerning poor security practices. <br/><br/>Data Breach notification statues: <br/>A Statue is written law passed by legislative body. California’s Data Security Breach Notification Statue: California enacted the first  data security breach statue after data security breach at ChoicePoint. <br/><br/>Since then, various states have enacted data security breach statues. <br/>They are based on the following elements: <br/>-Trigger for notice <br/>-Exceptions to Notification <br/>-Parties to Whom Disclosure is Required<br/>-Enforcement<br/><br/>A Number of Companies have been charged by FTC under Section 5 due to the fact that these companies failed to adequately protect security of personal information. <br/><br/>AT&T settled largest amount of money in history of data breach. They settled $25 million with FTC for call center data breach in Mexico Office and Philippines. The breach was the result of employee unauthorized use of customers information, jeopardizing the confidentiality of almost 280,000 customers. <br/><br/>In addition to the money penalty, FCC ordered AT&T to appoint compliance officer, develop and implement a compliance plan that included risk assessment, review and training, and provide notice to affected customers. <br/><br/>What constitutes privacy harm? Any breach that attempted to use customers personal information to identify them. <br/><br/>Data Retention and Disposal: <br/>In the United States, numerous states have enacted laws that require business to destroy personal information in a safe and effective fashion once it will no longer retain it. <br/><br/>Chapter 10 is about Education Privacy:<br/><br/>Student education record is  protected by Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). It is a federal statue. In Previous chapter, we saw that statue is written law passed by legislative body. <br/><br/>Students have fourth amendment right against seizures, unreasonable search. Schools must inform students about FERPA. FERPA’s rights are tied to guardian/parents for Students who are under eighteen. <br/><br/>Chapter 11 and 12 is about Employment and International Privacy. I do not have space to write them down. I hope you enjoy the book! ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

He boils down the principles of Architecture to Order, Arrangement, Eurythmy [ systematic movement of parts in reciting poetry or some literature ] and Economy. <br/><br/>He goes to explain in detail about each of these. He uses the word, “forms of expression.” He would say, forms of expression of arrangement are ground-plan, elevation, perspective. I like how he used this word.

Petroski explains engineering failures with stories from the previous century. He says failure helps to advance engineering knowledge. He stresses on learning from them especially in engineering. <br/><br/>I liked how he used a Poet crafting a poetry with an Engineer. Both conceive in their mind and perfect it, yet they know they cannot make it perfect. His example of, ""Failure by fatigue"" by using paper clip was thought-provoking. A Great book and quick read. Absolute certainty is not possible in structural or any types of engineering. <br/><br/>When railways were introduced; Writers and Poets were concerned about how it was impacting society. They made fun of failures of engineering. This seems to run parallel with our own lives in our age. <br/><br/>Something that I can take away from the book is looking into a lot of failures and learning from it. <br/>Overall, I would recommend this book to any layman who is interested in Engineering, failures.<br/><br/>Deus Vult, <br/>Gottfried  ",,,2,,,0,,,,,

This does not mean that everyone's view is subjective. <br/><br/>I learnt the Key themes in Chinese Culture, And it seems to be true of a lot of Asian cultures. I do not want to paint a broad-brush. Another question that came up in my mind was, What are the implications of those cultural thought/assumptions?<br/><br/>If Honor is made as the highest standard for every decision making, then the society tends to look down on people who are below their standard.

However -- I'm aware of all those authors. There are so many great things about the Western Civilization, and I feel that he did not build a solid case to argue for it. <br/><br/>I found the blind assertions in his book to be ridiculous without backing it up with evidence and solid arguments. He would say, ""X because of the Bible."" That is circular, and vague. Eastern Christians (Orthodox) also had the Bible. Indeed, he could have argued that Bible was a vehicle that transmitted knowledge easily from West.<br/><br/>I felt –– he could have wrote his arguments and thoughts sharper.

He starts from the earliest time of mental illness and to our modern day. Roy does a good job of delineating each era. I learnt a lot of stories, they were intriguing. It seems that, the issue of treating the individual as a human being is important. I am not sure if this is being followed everywhere. A person suffering from mental illness might be brushed aside and thought of as a beast. A lot of people, who were deemed unfit for society were tied into shackles and removed from society. <br/><br/>Now, Roy raises key concerns about institutions and developments through history. Initially Religious schools handled these cases, there were some positive results, however, this segment was taken over by affluent families. It seemed that from the reading, people from religious schools might put more empathy, serving people as a part of their life. This may not be necessarily true in all cases, but there's more possibility of them being better. Initially, treating these people were secretive, but after 1800's Psychiatry started to enter public domain as a credible employment. He seems to suggest the Moral therapy was successful in America in the beginning of 1800's but by the end of the century, Psychologists became more interested in the disease than patient. One thing, which I was surprised to learn is that in, every progress in this field, there's a philosophical backbone presupposed, for example: <i>John Locke</i> provided the lockean thinking sets for rationalizing illness, Darwin influenced Freud. <br/><br/>Overall, a great read. <br/><br/><i> Deus Vult </i> <br/>Gottfried <br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Erasmus decided to stay within the Roman Catholic church. Erasmus wants Luther to see the ramifications of saying, ""there is no free will."" However, Luther forcefully counters all the polemics made by Erasmus.<br/><br/>He says, everything is by God and if he is omniscient, his immutable will shall prevail no matter what. I could really feel Luther's caustic words. He quotes a lot of scriptures and simply shows that it does not support free will. It only says, ""What ought to be done, not what can be done."" <br/><br/>Luther is forceful, persuasive and writes in an abrasive tone. He had struggled with sin, even though he knew Christ died for his sins, He kept confessing and confessing. He felt horrible inside as he knew that he was not good enough, he tried everything to get rid of sin. It simply did not work, it won't work. It can be fought by the Spirit of God ––Romans 8:13.<br/>Finally, It was an epiphany when he found his answer in the book of Ephesians, ""By Grace you have been saved and not by works, so that no one can boast.""<br/><br/>On Sovereignty of God,<br/>Luther says, ""That God foreknows nothing by contingency, but that he foresees, purposes and does all things according to his immutable, eternal and infallible will. By this thunderbolt, Free-will is thrown prostrate and utterly dashed to pieces. Those, therefore, who would assert Free will, must either deny this thunderbolt, or pretend not to see it, or push it from them.""<br/><br/>In Bondage of the Will, Luther simply settles that Everything is by God and for his Glory.Nothing can be done by Man and if it is from Man, then it will be from the flesh. Whatever your position be in this topic, I would advise to be loving, gentle, warm and friendly. It seems that within the church, there's a lot of animosity, division as a result of this. A good book, I would recommend it to all Christians. <br/><br/>––Deus Vult––<br/>Gottfried <br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Bentham says, ethics is the art of directing men's actions to production of greatest possible quality of happiness. I am not sure if you can quantify happiness, emotions into mere numbers. But, it's great that he is trying and then he goes to crime and punishment, applies the principle of utility. He dives deep into each properties, which I was surprised to read. <br/><br/>The Summum bonum is defined as total net satisfaction of desires with everyone's desires with everyone's desires counting equally and with a value proportionate to their intensity. <br/><br/>If you have some legal background, this book is will be easier to read and understand. <br/>After Bentham, Mill writes on Liberty and Utilitarianism. I loved a lot of Mill's argument for Liberty and some of the questions he asked were difficult to answer. He argues for Freedom of speech and says, a lot of people try to silence another person's view if they do not like him or disagree with him. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I am not sure where the dividing line is on liberty of an individual and Society.<br/>Mill also writes about Calvinists, Mormonism on Liberty. Some of the religious sect would not agree with the society, could the majority force them? <br/><br/>He makes good case on a lot of things, I appreciate that Mill starts with Man is imperfect, perhaps he was influenced by some Christian thought. <br/><br/>A lot of the arguments we hear in Modern debates are already in earlier books, I was surprised by a lot of his examples. For example: If a Man becomes a thief, he is not a thief because he did it, it is the conditions of society that makes him do it.<br/><br/>Finally, if you want to learn about the basics of Utilitarians, I would recommend this book. <br/><br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I think, most of what he says stands True. <br/><br/>I learnt about power distribution in a political system. <br/>Machiavelli says if it is concentrated with just one person (King), and people under him are servants, then if the King is toppled, it is easier to maintain the Kingdom in the long run. This reminds me of North Korea, I do not see a long future for it anyway. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, if there are nobles, barons who share some influence then it will be difficult to maintain if toppled. I was thinking of China, which I used to think has a good political system. <br/>They do not waste time in election et cetera, however, the disadvantage in Chinese political system is that, if a new political party takes over, they will maintain the whole population under control. Meanwhile, it is difficult in America because the power is distributed differently. I can see how the Founders of America were cautious and knew all systems inside out. <br/><br/>I was surprised to find that Machiavelli supports people who believe in God for defense (Army) are better. He goes on to say that it is easier to train them as they will be Loyal to you. <br/>The people who depend only on money will desert you. He says ministries who only think of them are fickle minded, this reminds me of political system of Tamil Nadu. I wonder how long the Government can run? Based on Machiavelli's writings, not long. <br/><br/>He also talks about weakness of mercenaries, which, I think was one of the causes of downfall –– Roman and Ottoman Empire. <br/>The Ottoman Empire's Janissaries started to decline in power due to lack of training, corruption. <br/><br/>The Roman empire started to bring mercenaries from Germanic tribes.  There's always a tension between common people and nobles. Machiavelli says, common people are more important and the Prince ought to give them first priority. <br/><br/>""As the observance of religious rites is the foundation of a republic's greatness, so disrespect for them is the source of its ruin."" <br/><br/>""Where a fear of God is lacking, the state must either fail or be sustained by a fear of the ruler which may substitute for the lack of religion.""<br/><br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I loved his analogy of Wittgenstein's poker with Karl Popper. I'm glad I read this book, as Wright emphasizes our idea of heaven simply is Platonism, disembodied spirit going to heaven. The Christian life, as Wright describes, ""Life after Life after death."" It is the God's kingdom on earth and we will be *bodily* raised just as Christ was raised. Our present life matters, each act matters. God's kingdom is already here, it started with Christ, as he defeated death and sin. He also says, after we die, we will be Christ in paradise but that's not the end. He really emphasizes that it is not the end.

This debate took place in Ceylon around 1870's and it made headlines all across the world. I think, the Christian case was not well represented well Wesleyan Priest David Silva. Basically, the case against Christian faith were, instead of God, Ishwar, Jehovah were used, thus tricking the local people. Some inconsistencies are in the Bible. The body was stolen by disciples when the guards slept. If it were stolen, it seems that they would not simply go and die for a lie. It was controversial among everyone, they could have easily disproved it. I would say, he could do better than these arguments. Both sides threw the word omniscient, trying to play against each other. <br/><br/>The Christian side did not really make a good case against the Buddhist faith, they simply rambled with definitions in Pali. Simply accused Buddha of things and went deep into metaphysics. Buddha was a great teacher. Anyway, I do think the Buddhist priest argued better. I myself came across few questions while reading, if I could ask a Buddhist. Why would life be valuable if God did not create life? One ought to get rid of every desire in Life and attain Nirvana, but isn't that a desire itself? <br/><br/>It seems that the Buddhist monk simply stresses that one ought to get rid of desires, must strive to be morally perfect. Overall, the Buddhist side had a better case and won IMHO. <br/>I would love to discuss more on this. <br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,
