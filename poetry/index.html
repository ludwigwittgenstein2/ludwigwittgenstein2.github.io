                <p> I write poems, sporadically. I average about 6 poems per year.
                  Growing up in Tamil Nadu; I never imagined, one day I would enjoy crafting poems.
                  Poems were boring, not worth my time.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Perhaps, you might think the same?</i>
                  <br>Poems help you to reflect and capture meaningful experiences of your life. <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>How I started writing Poems? </i>
                  <br> My Journey in writing poetry started in 2014. <br>One Evening; I was walking to campus to meet a friend.
                  We planned to have dinner at the dining hall.
                  <br>My experience walking to campus was rich, stirring, vivid and memorable. I decided to capture the memory through poetry.
                   Thus, I started my journey to write poetry. I write about places, people, philosophy. I try to keep them simple. </p>
                  <i> I keep updating them </i><br>
                  <i> Read them and Enjoy!

  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="../img/poetry/lincoln.jpg" height="640" width="600"> </img>


<br>
<br>
<br>Abraham Lincoln — born without silver spoon,
<br>No Ivy Leaguer, Self-educating himself,
<br>Reading everything, Discipling himself,
<br>With self-education,
<br>His friends around notice Lincoln,
<br>Noticing his self-education legendary.
<br>
<br>Lincoln far being praised — I understand this!
<br>Always scolded — I feel you!
<br>Lincoln’s heart wounded, his soul sensitive,
<br>I feel your wounds, I feel your scars!
<br>
<br>Streaks of sadness, worries consumed him!
<br>He Collapsed!
<br>Oh my soul feels,
<br>Feels this intensity of his melancholy.
<br>
<br>Others tutored under renowned lawyers,
<br>Lincoln under none, Lincoln self-studied,
<br>Mark of his Ambition! I am too!
<br>Read hard — day and night — terribly hard,
<br>I am too!
<br>
<br>Oblivious to his surroundings — I am too!
<br>Oblivious to his friends — I am too!
<br>Streaks of Sadness, Worries!
<br>Finally mental breakdown!
<br>Oh Lincoln! How much you suffered?
<br>I experience, feel your suffering!
<br>
<br>Lincoln’s first love Ann Rutledge dying!
<br>Oh, that hurts him like a flesh being torn!
<br>Lincoln dejected — I feel the dejection!
<br>Heartbroken, Grieving!
<br>I feel you Lincoln.
<br>
<br>Young Lincoln Collapsed,
<br>In Agony, In Delirium;
<br>In Agony, his heart pounds with pain!
<br>I feel your pain Abe!
<br>
<br>Lincoln — In Distress, Helpless,
<br>I have been too!
<br>Pain and Sorrow consuming him,
<br>In Anguish, Gloom becoming Gloomer,
<br>I weep with Lincoln for his suffering.
<br>
<br>Lincoln breaking up with Mary,
<br>Again puts him in distress,
<br>Lincoln feels not more miserable,
<br>But writes, “I am the most miserable man living.”
<br>Oh I feel the depth of your words!
<br>Bleakness and Hopelessness!
<br>Woe! Such pain, I feel you.
<br>
<br>Lincoln, Suffered more,
<br>Hurt More,
<br>Struggled more,
<br>Penning, “I'm the loneliest man in the world”
<br>Woe! I peek at the depths of your pain.
<br>
<br>Lincoln often weeping in public!
<br>I feel your tears!
<br>Reciting his sad Poetry!
<br>I craft this for Lincoln.
<br>His melancholy everywhere as he walked!
<br>
<br>His friend Whitney observing Lincoln,
<br>Lincoln sitting by himself,
<br>“Wrapped in abstraction and gloom.”
<br>I feel the gloom!
<br>
<br>Lincoln soft, humble and compassionate — I am too!
<br>His Colleagues,
<br>His babe throwing insults at him!
<br>
<br>Cold, Heartless Man! saying, “They hate him”
<br>“They hate him to the core.”
<br>“They hate him to the core.”
<br>His Babe, never wanting to marry him ever!
<br>Oh I feel the distress of those words!
<br>
<br>Oh Lincoln! the distress in your soft heart,
<br>I weep, I grieve, I feel.
<br>With Lincoln, His suffering,
<br>With Lincoln, His trauma!
<br>I weep, I grieve, I feel.
<br>
<br>Despite suffering, bouts of gloominess,
<br>Despite darkest decades of suffering,
<br>Lincoln becomes President of United States,
<br>Lincoln becomes President of United States,
<br>— Abraham Lincoln —

<br>To the reader:
<br>
<br>Regardless of your socio-economic status, I implore you to read high-quality literary works. Your attention needs to be engaged with solid content, not fleeting pictures, images. Without such effort, your thoughts cannot raise higher, cannot coherently understand or form a thought.
<br>
<br>One of the most emotionally draining literary work, that I’ve written. This is the second work after — Grim Reaper. I wrote Grim Reaper, few years ago. Grim Reaper, unfortunately had put fear in one of the readers.
<br>
<br>I had paucity of words, gasping each moment for feelings, words to describe Abraham Lincoln, needing to understand depth of Abraham Lincoln’s mind. He was called Gorilla, et cetera.
<br>
<br>Comments: Abraham Lincoln is one of the most popular President in American History. This piece explores his main attributes of himself — his suffering, which was the most distinguishing mark of him.

<br>As a General he was successful. He is credited by historians for the new Empire.
<br>He’s directly responsible for English East India company’s expansion in India.

<br>
<br>References:
<br>The above poetry is not complex.
<br>It needs some understanding of Prussia,

<br>I found Socio-Economic questions within history quite intriguing.
<br>It’s fascinating to reflect upon generational shift of socio-economic communities.

<br>Terms:
<br>-Von Mulke, the actualizer of Clausewitz during Franco-Prussian War.
<br>-Von Manstein, the adept Strategist.
<br>-Junker i.e Junka (Yunka) - Social class in Prussia.

<p>
<br>On a Bright day………
<br>Bubbly, Extroverted, Descartes lands in a new country.
<br>Mingles with everyone,
<br>Happy, Joyful.
<br>Yet — constrained by circumstances, confused by others.
<br>
<br>Meeting everyone from evergreen state
<br>to the city of dreaming spires.
<br>Yet, none knowing Descartes.
<br>
<br>Suddenly — tragedy, death felt like a sting.
<br>
<br>On and On, He Flew Around,
<br>Frantic, Frantic,
<br>Caught between Two Worlds
<br>To find hope.
<br>
<br>His bearded general shaming him,
<br>Losing his face,
<br>None understanding him,
<br>The final day; showing up,
<br>He left, he left with shame.
<br>Yet, his King in his life.

My first poem this year. I came across how Descartes bled to death in Descartes's Secret Notebook by Amir D. Aczel.
Descartes was in Swedish court and influenced the young Princess .
She left Sweden to Rome. However, these are my own reflections on life.
Poetry is taken as metaphor and to be imagined. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>With little charm, Augustine was seeking fun,
<br>With gaiety walk, Augustine was seeking to be cool,
<br>Abruptly on a cloudy day,  Augustine was confronted.
<br>Confronted with this brokenness,

<br>On a snowy day, His King arrived.
<br>Arrived as the Spirit of God into him.
<br>Arrived as he invited him to take over.

<br>Swiftly, Augustine was adopted in his King’s family.
<br>Growing slowly into the image of his King.

Sandwich –– All we need is bread. <br>
Bread with Lox<br>
Bread with Chive<br>
Mix it up. Mix it up.<br>
Grab and Go<br>
<br>
Go, Go, Go.<br>
Go go go with one Sandwich<br>
Go go go two pieces of bread.<br>
Out of Time?<br>
Out of Time?<br>
<br>
Sandwich to the rescue,<br>
Munch, Much, Munch.<br>
Mix it up, Mix it up<br>

Throw some Onions & Lettuce,<br>
Mix it up, Mix it up.<br>

<br>
Honor, Honor, Honor is what you seek.<br>
To save your face,<br>
To save your face,<br>
From failure, from losing face.<br>
<br>
Honor, Honor, Honor is what you seek,<br>
Honor, Honor from your parents,<br>
Honor, Honor to look good,<br>
Yet, deep inside you know -- It's flimsy.<br>
<br>
Shame, Shame is what you instill,<br>
On and On the same cycle for generations.<br>
Not Pausing, and asking -- Why?<br>
<br>
Avoiding, Avoiding Shame,<br>
Every Decision follows from,<br>
How you look in front of people,<br>
Self-interest is what you lack,<br>
Self-interest is what you ought to pursue,<br>
<br>
Debate is disharmony,<br>
Debate shames your face,<br>
Seeking Truth is not your concern,<br>
To Lose Face is to lose your soul,<br>
To Lose Face is to lose your essence,<br>
<br>
Yet, My KING lost his face for you,<br>
Yet, My KING was shamed for you,<br>
Shamed in Death, suffering for you,<br>
<br>
For Eternal Honor,<br>
For Eternal Glory,<br>
MY KING, Make Him your KING.<br>

John, the New Englander travels, <br>
Travels with all his books, <br>
His first sight of Abigail -–nonchalant; <br>
Gently, back to his books. <br>
<br>
John, the New Englander gazes, <br>
Gazes into Abigail's brown eyes,<br>
Oops, He forgets himself, <br>
Oops, He falls for Abigail's eyes.<br>
Abigail–– a swarthy Omaha princess. <br>
<br>
Admiration –– He forgets his books. <br>
Attention –– He seeks.<br>
Suddenly, realizing his own enchantment, <br>
Abigail quips John as a "Scholar"<br>
John chuckles inside, thanking his King. <br>
<br>
Wishing to meet, John requests Abigail. <br>
Abigail misconstrues John. <br>
John sighs –– Abigail around, John reluctant to be close by, <br>
Gently reminding himself of his King.<br>
<br>
John delights in Abigail's Joy.<br>
Abigail's Joy in music, <br>
Abigail's leisure in Hammock. <br>
Musing Abigail's ravishing brown eyes, <br>
Chuckles, thinking if Abigail thinks of John.<br>
<br>
Days passing by –– Time to leave. <br>
John thanks Abigail for her King, <br>
Leaving, not knowing where.<br>
Musing of Abigail<br>
Musing.......<br>

<b>Desire<br></b>
Do you desire?<br>
Perhaps, to be happy.<br>
Do you desire each day?<br>
Perhaps, to seek love. <br>
<br>
As you wallow in darkness –– When is that thirst enough? <br>
As you try to fill the void by the world,<br>
Finding to realize that it is fleeting.<br>
The more you try –– more frustrated you become.<br>
<br>
As a deer pants for flowing streams, <br>
Your own soul craves to thirst<br>
for more,<br>
Thirsts for a deeper longing –– though none can fit, present in the world.<br>
Do not stop to desire –– to not desire, is a desire.<br>
<br>
Could the thirst be filled?<br>
The thirst, could it be be satisfied? <br>
Could it be?<br>
Yes –– Cherishing something of infinite importance?<br>
It can be......<br>
It can be......<br>

Love<br>

Wouldn't you love to know? <br>

Love? <br>

Did I say Love? <br>
<br>
Love is not a feeling, <br>

If it were a feeling, it is going to crash.<br>

Crash as the waves crash into the shores, waiting for the next one to arrive. <br>

Love is a choice, <br>
<br>
A choice which belongs to you,<br>

Eros is a feeling, a passive desire of the flesh, <br>

A Man shackled by Eros, empties his heart more and more, <br>

As He gratifies his flesh, he is blinded by Eros, <br>

Walking on the path of Eros, he looks back with no Love, <br>

But Which Love? <br>
<br>
An Agape Love which is committing till the last breath, <br>

An Agape Love which is not self seeking to boast itself, <br>

An Agape Love which keeps no track of wrong doings, <br>

An Agape Love which breaks shackles of desires of the flesh, <br>

Possibly, the greatest of Love is Agape.<br>

Agape -- the unconditional love to sacrifice everything for you, <br>
<br>
To be in Love is to be all vulnerable. <br>

He loved you unconditionally and suffered the most. <br>

We Love, because he loved his creation first<br>

Wouldn't you love to have that in your life? <br>

A Life without shame, guilt and sorrow? <br>
<br>
Only through him,  you are set free from the passive desires of the flesh<br>

At the height of procrastination, <br>

A simple text changes your moment,<br>
Looking through the window,<br>
You see the incessant rain, <br>
Feeling not to go outside.<br>
<br>
Walking outside, <br>
You hear the gust of the wind,<br>
The gentle rain brushes my face, <br>
As I run across the streets like a race,<br>
Gazing the beautiful dusky sky,<br>
The trees dancing in the wind,<br>
The sound of the sudden squall, <br>
Your umbrellas turn up-side down,<br>
The feeling of joy enters you, <br>
A simple text can bring joyful memory,<br>
Gratitude to the kind friend.<br>
<br>
A short journey yet so memorable.<br>
