                <h1><b> My Poems</h1> </b>
                <p> I write poems, time to time. I had never thought that I would enjoy writing poems.
                  Growing up in Tamil Nadu, India. Poems were boring, not worth my time.

                  <i>Perhaps, you might think the same?</i>

                  Here's a thought for you, Poems help you reflect on experiences of people, and deeper insights in life. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>"Poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason -- Novalis."</b>

                  <br>
                  <br> My journey in writing poetry started on one evening 2014. I was walking to campus to meet a friend;
                  My experience walking to campus was vivid, memorable. I decided to write poetry out of the blue.
                  Thus, started my journey to write poetry. I write about places, spirtual musing, philosophy. </p>
                  <i> I will keep updating them </i><br>
                  <i> Read them and Enjoy!

  <font size="5">Augustine loves... </b> <br> </u></font>
  <br>
<img src="../img/poetry/augustine.jpg" height="620" width="450"></img>
<br>
<br>
<br>With little charm, Augustine was seeking fun,
<br>With gaiety walk, Augustine was seeking to be cool,
<br>Abruptly on a cloudy day,  Augustine was confronted.
<br>Confronted with this brokenness,

<br>On a snowy day, His King arrived.
<br>Arrived as the Spirit of God into him.
<br>Arrived as he invited him to take over.

<br>Swiftly, Augustine was adopted in his King’s family.
<br>Growing slowly into the image of his King.
<br>Growing in his thirst for Knowledge,
<br>Growing in his thirst for Learning.

<br>Augustine loves reading…..
<br>Augustine loves reading……

<br>In the Memory of my love for my King, who imparted
<br>me the last lines of this poem.

<br>
Honor, Honor, Honor is what you seek.<br>
To save your face,<br>
To save your face,<br>
From failure, from losing face.<br>
<br>
Honor, Honor, Honor is what you seek,<br>
Honor, Honor from your parents,<br>
Honor, Honor to look good,<br>
Yet, deep inside you know -- It's flimsy.<br>
<br>
Shame, Shame is what you instill,<br>
On and On the same cycle for generations.<br>
Not Pausing, and asking -- Why?<br>
<br>
Avoiding, Avoiding Shame,<br>
Every Decision follows from,<br>
How you look in front of people,<br>
Self-interest is what you lack,<br>
Self-interest is what you ought to pursue,<br>
<br>
Debate is disharmony,<br>
Debate shames your face,<br>
Seeking Truth is not your concern,<br>
To Lose Face is to lose your soul,<br>
To Lose Face is to lose your essence,<br>
<br>
Yet, My KING lost his face for you,<br>
Yet, My KING was shamed for you,<br>
Shamed in Death, suffering for you,<br>
<br>
For Eternal Honor,<br>
For Eternal Glory,<br>
MY KING, Make Him your KING.<br>

John, the New Englander travels, <br>
Travels with all his books, <br>
His first sight of Abigail -–nonchalant; <br>
Gently, back to his books. <br>
<br>
John, the New Englander gazes, <br>
Gazes into Abigail's brown eyes,<br>
Oops, He forgets himself, <br>
Oops, He falls for Abigail's eyes.<br>
Abigail–– a swarthy Omaha princess. <br>
<br>
Admiration –– He forgets his books. <br>
Attention –– He seeks.<br>
Suddenly, realizing his own enchantment, <br>
Abigail quips John as a "Scholar"<br>
John chuckles inside, thanking his King. <br>
<br>
Wishing to meet, John requests Abigail. <br>
Abigail misconstrues John. <br>
John sighs –– Abigail around, John reluctant to be close by, <br>
Gently reminding himself of his King.<br>
<br>
John delights in Abigail's Joy.<br>
Abigail's Joy in music, <br>
Abigail's leisure in Hammock. <br>
Musing Abigail's ravishing brown eyes, <br>
Chuckles, thinking if Abigail thinks of John.<br>
<br>
Days passing by –– Time to leave. <br>
John thanks Abigail for her King, <br>
Leaving, not knowing where.<br>
Musing of Abigail<br>
Musing.......<br>

Swiftly, Transformed from a wretched filth. <br>

<b>Desire<br></b>
Do you desire?<br>
Perhaps, to be happy.<br>
Do you desire each day?<br>
Perhaps, to seek love. <br>
<br>
As you wallow in darkness –– When is that thirst enough? <br>
As you try to fill the void by the world,<br>
Finding to realize that it is fleeting.<br>
The more you try –– more frustrated you become.<br>
<br>
As a deer pants for flowing streams, <br>
Your own soul craves to thirst<br>
for more,<br>
Thirsts for a deeper longing –– though none can fit, present in the world.<br>
Do not stop to desire –– to not desire, is a desire.<br>
<br>
Could the thirst be filled?<br>
The thirst, could it be be satisfied? <br>
Could it be?<br>
Yes –– Cherishing something of infinite importance?<br>
It can be......<br>
It can be......<br>

Eventually driving yourself to decay.<br>

Love<br>

Wouldn't you love to know? <br>

Love? <br>

Did I say Love? <br>
<br>
Love is not a feeling, <br>

If it were a feeling, it is going to crash.<br>

Crash as the waves crash into the shores, waiting for the next one to arrive. <br>

Love is a choice, <br>
<br>
A choice which belongs to you,<br>

Eros is a feeling, a passive desire of the flesh, <br>

A Man shackled by Eros, empties his heart more and more, <br>

As He gratifies his flesh, he is blinded by Eros, <br>

Walking on the path of Eros, he looks back with no Love, <br>

But Which Love? <br>
<br>
An Agape Love which is committing till the last breath, <br>

An Agape Love which is not self seeking to boast itself, <br>

An Agape Love which keeps no track of wrong doings, <br>

An Agape Love which breaks shackles of desires of the flesh, <br>

Possibly, the greatest of Love is Agape.<br>

Agape -- the unconditional love to sacrifice everything for you, <br>
<br>
To be in Love is to be all vulnerable. <br>

He loved you unconditionally and suffered the most. <br>

We Love, because he loved his creation first<br>

Wouldn't you love to have that in your life? <br>

A Life without shame, guilt and sorrow? <br>
<br>
Only through him,  you are set free from the passive desires of the flesh<br>
<br>

Søren retreats without reason.<br>
<br>
Regine's heart is shattered,<br>
Regine's dreams are lost.<br>
<br>
Regine pleads.....<br>
Regine pleads to get her Prince back,<br>
Her heart aches,<br>
Aches more than a fire burning....<br>
Aches more than her soul,<br>
<br>
Søren still loves Regine,<br>
Søren still breathes for Regine,<br>
<br>
Søren dies .....<br>
Søren dies .....leaving his wealth for Regine.<br>

The Grim Reaper <br>
<br>
The Grim reaper is going to take you away,<br>
Away conquering everyone, no matter if you're a patrician or pleb.<br>
Not Petrified by the Grim reaper unless, <br>
The Grim Reaper moves close to someone you know.<br>
<br>
The Grim Reaper brings agony;<br>
An Agony which starts from your heart beat<br>
The Grim Reaper brings trauma,<br>
A Trauma which leads to torture. <br>
The Grim Reaper brings heartache,<br>
A Heartache which makes you tearful.<br>
<br>
Do you exist merely to meet the Grim reaper?<br>
What if you meet someone after the Grim Reaper?<br>
The Grim Reaper is awaiting patiently,<br>
Awaiting.....<br>
Awaiting.....<br>

The Living Legend   <br>
  <br>
Would you ever dream?  <br>
In an eternity, thou would meet;  <br>
The Living Legend.  <br>
  <br>
Would you describe how thou feel?  <br>
Flabbergasted by erudition,  <br>
Discerning the breath of almighty,  <br>
Exhilarated no matter how arduous thou journey is.  <br>
  <br>
Would you describe thou sea change?  <br>
Life changes so much that nobody can believe thou shadow.  <br>
Thou accomplish, the Impossible with the breath of almighty.  <br>
Feeling the presence of the breath of almighty every second.  <br>
  <br>
Would you limn thou emotions ?  <br>
Like an empty glass filling with water,  <br>
You could sentient the filling of emotions in your heart,  <br>
Throwing away the past haughtiness,  <br>
Walking with the breath of almighty every day,  <br>
.  <br>
.  <br>

.  <br>
.  <br>
Reverence for the Living legend . . .   <br>

<br>


At the height of procrastination, <br>
Forty emails pile up,<br>
Homework to do, <br>
A simple text changes your moment,<br>
Looking through the window,<br>
You see the incessant rain, <br>
Feeling not to go outside.<br>
<br>
Walking outside, <br>
You hear the gust of the wind,<br>
The gentle rain brushes my face, <br>
As I run across the streets like a race,<br>
Gazing the beautiful dusky sky,<br>
The trees dancing in the wind,<br>
The sound of the sudden squall, <br>
Your umbrellas turn up-side down,<br>
The feeling of joy enters you, <br>
A simple text can bring joyful memory,<br>
Gratitude to the kind friend.<br>
<br>
A short journey yet so memorable.<br>
<br>
Life! <br>
